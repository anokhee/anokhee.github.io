              <h3>About RoadSync</h3>
              <p>
                RoadSync is a logistics & payments software with a variety of users, both B2B and B2C. Its B2B users consist of Warehouses, Carrier Services, and Tow & Repair while the B2C users are the truck drivers making deliveries. During my time at RoadSync, the company's goal was to expand its B2C user base and establish itself as the go-to application for these drivers on the road. As the first in-house designer, I got to make early product & visual design decisions. I also ideated and created the first round of designs for the mobile app.

              <h3>My Design Process</h3>
              <p>During my time at RoadSync, I worked across the Product, Engineering, and Marketing teams. In general, my design process varies depended on the task or team I work with, but I used the following design process to guide me whenever I felt stuck.</p>

                  <h3>Illustrations</h3>
                  <p>Illustration can convey a product's visual identity and maintain consistency across many 
                    offerings. When I started at RoadSync, I was working part-time hours while in school. I 
                    found some free time to experiment with illustration styles for RoadSync's branding. 
                    RoadSync used these custom illustrations across the app while the brand voice was still in 
                    flux. </p>

              <h4>Understanding RoadSync's B2B and B2C users.</h4>
              <p>With so many carriers and warehouses using RoadSync, we saw opportunity to expand product offerings to truck drivers. Our B2B users were generating potential B2C users. To deliver the right products to our users, we needed to understand them as people. Unfortunately, drivers showed little interest in providing information about themselves to us. The question now was "How do we get to know people who don't want to be known?"</p>

                  <p>
                    Blogs, social media, and forums were great resources for general research and 
                    discovery. These sources provided an unfiltered look into our user base in 
                    the wild. Blogs often provided detailed information about the trucking 
                    industry. Social media provided a somewhat intimate look into their emotions 
                    and pain points. Forums gave us a combination of both.

                  <p>
                    Survey tools like Typeform are helpful in collecting in-app feedback for 
                    products and features. But, often we'd see a one-star rating accompanied by 
                    an expletive with no explanation. Although it was a good way to collect a lot
                    of quick feedback, we couldn't use it method to get a detailed reading on our 
                    users as human beings.

                    Survey tools like Typeform can provide in-app feedback about specific offerings or

                    explanation. Although it was a good way to measure user satisfaction, we couldn't use 
                    it method to get a detailed reading on our users as human beings.

                    After arriving at the delivery destination (i.e., a warehouse), a lumper 
                    comes out to the dock to unload the contents of a truck. Although this saves 
                    the driver the time and energy it takes to unload their truck themselves, 
                    it can cost them anywhere between $50-$400 out of pocket.
