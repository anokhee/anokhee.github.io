              <h3>Sketches & Doodles</h3>
              <p>A lot of the design work was open-ended and conceptual. When I joined, Tourial wasn't even 
                a year old yet. The product direction at this stage was broad and required a lot of discovery 
                to hone in on. I had opportunity to experiment with tons of different ideas and directions 
                which came to me at random times. Sketching and doodling were a quick and easy way to put 
                down stream-of-conscious ideas which popped up in the middle of a meeting, for example. </p>

              <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
              <p>For ideas that stuck, I refined the sketches by turning them into low-fidelity wireframes in Figma. I often included some interaction flows at this stage. For Product Managers, the interactions either visualized or informed the user stories. For Engineers, the wireframes and accompanying actions led to tangible conversations around feasibility. For Business Development, it helped to see how things were going. </p>

              <h3>Developer Handoff</h3>
              <p>With Figma, developer handoff was straightforward most of the time. But with everyone working 
                remotely, and often on many features at once, it was hard to keep track of everything. To facilitate handoff, I added design notes to further explain interactions and cut down on some of the back-and-forth. </p>

              <h3>Discovery with User Interviews</h3>
              <p>We sent out emails requesting 30-minute interviews from users. Fortunately for us, our users were happy to oblige. We used these interviews to find out more about each person's role at their company. We wanted to know how they used Tourial and how many others built/updated their product tours.</p>
              <p>We encouraged them to talk about each person's role and process. What other tools do they use on a daily basis? Based on this, we had an idea of what UI patterns they were comfortable with and used to. </p>

            <h3>First Iteration</h3>
            <p>
              After our initial interviews, we learned that our users wanted to see granular information about time spent per 
              page, number of CTA clicks, and form views and submissions. I mocked up a handful of charts based on existing company 
              data to get an idea of how it would look on a chart.

              <li class="unpadded">Click data could be well-represented with pie charts, but there was still something missing. </li>
              <li class="unpadded">Line charts and bar charts worked well when displaying data for linear tours. By replacing the x-axis variable, the same chart could represent a variety of useful data. But again, the issue of nonlinear tours came up. </li>
              <li class="unpadded">We hadn't yet figured out a good way to represent form interaction data on a chart. </li>
