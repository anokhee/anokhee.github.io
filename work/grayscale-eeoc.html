          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Grayscale is a B2B hiring platform that integrates with customers’
            ATS to automate high-volume recruiting tasks. At its heart lives an
            AI Assistant named Gracie.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I joined, Gracie lived on customers' career sites to help
            prospective candidates identify which jobs they were qualified for.
            Over time, she grew into a robust hiring assistant who could guide
            them through applications, text them on their preferred channel, and
            even act as their main point of contact through the full application
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the sole UX Designer, I worked with the PM, VP of
            Product/Engineering, CTO, and developers to translate Grayscale's
            rapidly evolving AI-powered capabilities into intuitive interfaces.

          <h3>1. Resume Uploads</h3>
          <p>
            Candidates couldn't upload their resume directly into Gracie's chat
            window. They had to follow a link to the job application, which
            broke the conversational flow.

        <article class="note">
          <h3>2. EEOC Questionnaires</h3>
          <p>
            In order for Gracie to be a compliant job application, a demographic
            questionnaire needed to appear at some point during the chat
            experience.

          <h3>3. Platform Parity</h3>
          <p>
            Many candidates interact with Gracie via SMS and WhatsApp channels,
            so both these experienced needed to be delivered consistently across
            desktop and mobile web.

              was quite open.

          <h2>Discovery</h2>
          <div class="img-container">
            <p>
              Without direct access to candidates using Gracie, I turned to
              secondary research: job-hunting forums, candidate discussions, and
              competitive analysis for a window into how job seekers perceived
              AI in the application process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most candidates interacting with Gracie were applying to frontline
              roles. For many, especially minorities, trust in the job-seeking
              process is fragile. It’s well-documented that applicants sometimes
              alter their names on résumés to appear “less foreign.” I worried
              that if Gracie’s flow felt too opaque, candidates might assume she
              was just another biased gatekeeper and abandon their applications
              altogether.
            </p>
            <img src="../imgs/grayscale/peak-privilege.png" alt="FIX" />
            <p class="caption-text">
              Interestingly, I learned that fear of discrimination is common
              amongst Reddit users who identify as white males. If the
              self-proclaimed “peak privelleged” doesn’t trust EEOC
              questionnaires, that’s a UX problem!

                Rather than overwhelming candidates with a wall of dense legal
                text, the survey followed a stepper format. Each step contained
                only one or two questions, keeping the interaction lightweight
                and providing a sense of progress.

                <span class="strong">Signals of Trust:</span> Before opening the
                survey, Gracie reassured candidates in plain language that
                responses were voluntary and had no impact on hiring outcomes.
                Inside the flow, an official EEOC disclaimer and shield icon
                reinforced privacy and compliance. Informational copy linked out
                to EEOC documentation for candidates who wanted more detail.

                <span class="strong">Tone Shift for Security</span> Once the
                EEOC widget opened, Gracie’s conversational voice paused and
                shifted to a more formal, secure tone. This contrast underscored
                that demographic answers were confidential and treated
                differently than general chatbot interactions.

          <p>
            My design allowed candidates to complete EEOC surveys securely
            across all channels, while preserving conversational flow and
            strengthening trust in Gracie. This work helped Grayscale to
            maintain compliance at enterprise a scale of up to hundreds of
            millions of applications processed through the platform, and
            contributed to improved completion rates, averaging around 25% from
            application start to finish.
