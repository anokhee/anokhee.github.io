          <h1>Designing a Secure EEOC Widget for Grayscale's AI Chatbot</h1>
          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Grayscale is a B2B hiring platform that integrates with customers’
            ATS to automate high-volume recruiting tasks. At its heart lives an
            AI Assistant named Gracie.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I joined, Gracie was an informational chatbot customers could
            embed on their careers sites. Over time, she grew into a robust
            hiring assistant – guiding prospective candidates through
            applications, texting them on their preferred channel, and even
            acting as their main point of contact through complex recruiting
            flows at enterprise scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the sole UX Designer, I worked with the PM, VP of
            Product/Engineering, CTO, and developers to translate Grayscale's
            rapidly evolving AI-powered capabilities into intuitive interfaces.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            U.S. job applications are required to collect voluntary demographic
            data using a protected EEOC questionnaire. In order for Grayscale to
            maintain compliance, this questionnaire has to appear at some point
            during Gracie's application process.
          </p>
          <h3>High-Level Design Challenges</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Gracie needs to present the questionnaire to applicants, then pass
              the answers into customers’ systems without storing them in
              Grayscale.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many candidates interact with Gracie via SMS and WhatsApp
              channels, so the EEOC questionnaire needs to be delivered
              consistently across desktop and mobile web.
            </li>
            <li>
              I was constrained by time and did not have access to end users to
              conduct research.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Discovery</h2>
          <div class="img-container">
            <p>
              Although I had some access to B2B users, I didn’t have direct
              insights from candidates using Gracie. Still, I wanted to ground
              my design decisions in research before diving in.
            </p>
            <h3>What I Knew</h3>
            <p>
              As with any new technology, AI raises a lot of suspicion. Given
              the novelty of a chatbot-driven job application process, I wanted
              to tread lightly to avoid alienating users who might already feel
              uneasy.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s well-documented that minorities sometimes alter their names
              on résumés to appear “less foreign” and reduce the chance of
              discrimination. This led me to hypothesize that marginalized
              candidates might be especially cautious — even distrustful enough
              of demographic surveys to abandon their applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              To validate my hypotheses, I relied on secondary research methods:
              exploring job-hunting forums, reviewing candidate discussions, and
              conducting competitive analysis. I examined how well-known
              companies integrated surveys, secure uploads, and compliance
              widgets into their chatbot flows.
            </p>

          <h3>Findings</h3>
          <!-- Organize these as pretty stickies -->
          <h4>1. Few Established Patterns</h4>
          <p>
            AI chat–driven applications are still relatively new, with few
            well-established UX patterns to lean on while designing.
          </p>
          <h4>2. Linkouts Interrupt the Flow of Conversation</h4>
          <p>
            Some chatbots opened surveys or questionnaires in a separate modal,
            tab, or new window. EEOC surveys usually appear at the end of an
            application, so I wanted to avoid confusion or drop-off by keeping
            applicants inside the chat window until the application was
            submitted.
          </p>
          <h4>3. EEOC Content Feels Unapproachable</h4>
          <p>
            Questionnaires contain a lot of intimidating legal jargon. To keep
            engagement high toward end of the application, the design needed to
            make the experience feel approachable so that they didn't dropoff at
            the last minute.
          </p>
          <h4>4. Not Everyone Has Their Own Computer</h4>
          <p>
            Many people apply to frontline roles from public computers, such as
            at libraries, where pop-up blockers are enabled as a security
            measure and usually can’t be disabled. Inserting a questionnaire
            into a popup could lock prospective applicants out of completing
            their applications, narrowing the hiring pool unnecessarily.
          </p>
          <h4>5. Everyone Worries About Discrimination</h4>
          <p>
            Many applicants incorrectly assume that their EEOC responses will
            influence the outcome of their application. This, paired with
            questions around how AI will handle their sensitive demographic
            information, could make even legally-protected EEOC surveys feel
            suspect, contributing to drop-off.
          </p>
          <img src="../imgs/grayscale/peak-privilege.png" alt="FIX" />
          <p class="caption-text">
            Interestingly, fear of discrimination is quite common among users
            who identify as white males on Reddit. If even the self-proclaimed
            “peak privelleged” among us doesn’t trust EEOC questionnaires,
            that’s a UX problem!

            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Continuity of Flow:</span>
                For web applicants, the EEOC survey was embedded directly inside
                the chat as a widget, so candidates never felt pulled out of the
                conversation. For SMS and WhatsApp users, a link opened in the
                default mobile browser and mimicked the chat widget experience.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Stepped Form:</span>
                Rather than overwhelming candidates with a wall of dense legal
                text, the survey followed a stepper format. Each step contained
                only one or two questions, keeping the interaction lightweight
                and providing a sense of progress.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Signals of Trust:</span> Before opening the
                survey, Gracie reassured candidates in plain language that
                responses were voluntary and had no impact on hiring outcomes.
                Inside the flow, an official EEOC disclaimer and shield icon
                reinforced privacy and compliance. Informational copy linked out
                to EEOC documentation for candidates who wanted more detail.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Tone Shift for Security</span> Once the
                EEOC widget opened, Gracie’s conversational voice paused and
                shifted to a more formal, secure tone. This contrast underscored
                that demographic answers were confidential and treated
                differently than general chatbot interactions.

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>
            My design allowed candidates to complete EEOC surveys securely
            across all channels, while preserving conversational flow and
            strengthening trust in Gracie. This work helped Grayscale to
            maintain compliance at enterprise a scale of up to hundreds of
            millions of applications processed through the platform, and
            contributed to improved completion rates, averaging around 25% from
            application start to finish.
