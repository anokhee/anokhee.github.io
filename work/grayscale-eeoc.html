          <h1>Designing a Secure EEOC Widget for Grayscale's AI Chatbot</h1>
          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Grayscale is a B2B hiring platform that integrates with customers’
            ATS to automate high-volume recruiting tasks. At its heart lives an
            AI Assistant named Gracie.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I joined, Gracie was an informational chatbot customers could
            embed on their careers sites. Over time, she grew into a robust
            hiring assistant – guiding prospective candidates through
            applications, texting them on their preferred channel, and even
            acting as their main point of contact through complex recruiting
            flows at enterprise scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the sole UX Designer, I worked with the PM, VP of
            Product/Engineering, CTO, and developers to translate Grayscale's
            rapidly evolving AI-powered capabilities into intuitive interfaces.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            U.S. job applications are required to collect voluntary demographic
            data using a protected EEOC questionnaire. In order for Grayscale to
            maintain compliance, this questionnaire has to appear at some point
            during Gracie's application process.
          </p>
          <h3>High-Level Design Challenges</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Gracie needs to present the questionnaire to applicants, then pass
              the answers into customers’ systems without storing them in
              Grayscale.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many candidates interact with Gracie via SMS and WhatsApp
              channels, so the EEOC questionnaire needs to be delivered
              consistently across desktop and mobile web.
            </li>
            <li>
              I was constrained by time and did not have access to end users to
              conduct research.

          <h2>Discovery</h2>
          <div class="img-container">
            <p>
              Although I had some access to B2B users, I didn’t have direct
              insights from candidates using Gracie. Still, I wanted to ground
              my design decisions in research before diving in.
            </p>
            <h3>What I Knew</h3>
            <p>
              As with any new technology, AI raises a lot of suspicion. Given
              the novelty of a chatbot-driven job application process, I wanted
              to tread lightly to avoid alienating users who might already feel
              uneasy.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s well-documented that minorities sometimes alter their names
              on résumés to appear “less foreign” and reduce the chance of
              discrimination. This led me to hypothesize that marginalized
              candidates might be especially cautious — even distrustful enough
              of demographic surveys to abandon their applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              To validate my hypotheses, I relied on secondary research methods:
              exploring job-hunting forums, reviewing candidate discussions, and
              conducting competitive analysis. I examined how well-known
              companies integrated surveys, secure uploads, and compliance
              widgets into their chatbot flows.

            While trying to confirm my hypothesis, I learned that fear of job
            discrimination is quite common among Reddit users who identify as
            white males. If even the self-proclaimed “peak privelleged” among us
            doesn’t trust EEOC questionnaires, that’s a UX problem!

            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Stepped Form:</span>
                Rather than overwhelming candidates with a wall of dense legal
                text, the survey followed a stepper format. Each step contained
                only one or two questions, keeping the interaction lightweight
                and providing a sense of progress.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Signals of Trust:</span> Before opening the
                survey, Gracie reassured candidates in plain language that
                responses were voluntary and had no impact on hiring outcomes.
                Inside the flow, an official EEOC disclaimer and shield icon
                reinforced privacy and compliance. Informational copy linked out
                to EEOC documentation for candidates who wanted more detail.

                <span class="strong">Tone Shift for Security</span> Once the
                EEOC widget opened, Gracie’s conversational voice paused and
                shifted to a more formal, secure tone. This contrast underscored
                that demographic answers were confidential and treated
                differently than general chatbot interactions.

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>
            My design allowed candidates to complete EEOC surveys securely
            across all channels, while preserving conversational flow and
            strengthening trust in Gracie. This work helped Grayscale to
            maintain compliance at enterprise a scale of up to hundreds of
            millions of applications processed through the platform, and
            contributed to improved completion rates, averaging around 25% from
            application start to finish.
