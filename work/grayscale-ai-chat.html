          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Grayscale is a B2B2C hiring platform that integrates with customers‚Äô
            ATS to automate high-volume recruiting tasks. At its heart lives an
            AI Assistant named Gracie.
          </p>
          <p>
            From keeping candidates warm by texting them directly, Gracie
            quickly expanded to support the
            <span class="strong">full application process</span> through SMS,
            WhatsApp, and web.

          <h2>Designing Fast in a Controversial New Domain</h2>
          <p>
            Gracie excelled at engagement but had some feature gaps preventing
            her from guiding prospective applicants through the full application
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without these features,
            <span class="strong"
              >recruiters were left chasing applicants down to collect digital
              paperwork</span
            >, which was inefficient for both sides.

              <h1>üö´üìÑ</h1>
              <h3>No Document Uploads</h3>
              <p>
                Candidates couldn‚Äôt upload documents like resumes directly to
                Gracie. Redirecting them to external links interrupted the
                conversation & increased the risk of dropoff.

              <h3>No EEOC Questionnaires</h3>
              <p>
                To comply with federal hiring regulations, Gracie needed to
                present an EEOC questionnaire during the conversational
                application flow.

              <h3>No Platform Parity</h3>
              <p>
                Most frontline candidates engaged with Gracie through SMS and
                WhatsApp, so features needed to be delivered consistently across
                both desktop and mobile web.

            Although these appear to be fairly simple design asks, the reality
            was that there were several factors I had to contend with.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Retrofitting Designs to Code</h3>
          <p>
            When I joined, the development team had been working without a
            designer for some time. They already built much of the application
            logic on the back end, but the user experience had yet to be
            defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of the typical design-first process,
            <span class="strong"
              >I had to design patterns for the front end around the existing
              system architecture.</span
            >
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
          <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../imgs/grayscale/sketch.png" alt="Early design sketch" />
            <p class="caption-text">
              While keeping the codebase in mind constrained certain design
              possibilities, it also enabled me to move quickly and avoid
              engineering re-work by getting creative within those boundaries.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
          <h3>2. Limited Access to Irate Consumer Users</h3>
          <p>
            While recruiters loved Gracie for the convenience she brought to
            their daily tasks,
            <span class="strong"
              >candidates didn't love applying for jobs through an AI
              Chatbot.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Grayscale sold to recruiters, not jobseekers, I had limited
            access to user insights to design candidate-facing products around.
            However, I knew if the experience felt untrustworthy, candidates
            might drop-off mid-conversation, which was exactly what customers
            didn't want.
          </p>
          <p>
            I read through jobhunting forums to understand how people applying
            to high-volume roles felt about chatbot-driven applications. The
            sentiment ranged from confusion to outright hostility, with
            <span class="strong"
              >the core fear being that a biased AI would filter them out before
              a human ever looked at their application.</span
            >
          </p>

          <div class="img-container">

          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
          <h3>3. The Business Case for Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            The truth was that Grayscale handled candidate privacy seriously. I
            wanted to make that commitment visible to jobseekers by advocating
            internally for edge cases where applicants risked exclusion and
            designing UI patterns that
            <span class="strong"
              >reassured jobseekers that their application would be considered
              fairly.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as the sole designer, I needed to make a good case for
            anything that adds time to development work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The business case for accessible, secure chatbot designs is that
            <span class="strong"
              >in high-volume hiring, customers need to keep their pipelines
              full.</span
            >
            Making applications clear and accessible to as many candidates as
            possible directly serves that interest.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            I designed conversational flows, mobile-first UI patterns, and
            plain-language microcopy that reduced friction while reinforcing
            trust. These interventions covered everything from document upload
            to demographic disclosure. A good example of this work is the
            redesigned EEOC survey experience, which worked consistently across
