          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Grayscale is a hiring platform that integrates with customers‚Äô ATS
            to automate high-volume recruiting tasks. At its heart lives an AI
            Assistant named Gracie.
          </p>
          <p>
            From keeping candidates warm by texting them directly, Gracie
            quickly expanded to support the
            <span class="strong">full application process</span> through SMS,
            WhatsApp, and web.
          </p>

          <h2>Designing Swiftly in a Controversial Domain</h2>
          <p>
            Gracie excelled at engagement but couldn't yet guide prospective
            candidates through the full application experience. This left
            <span class="strong">recruiters chasing candidates down</span> to
            collect resumes and other pre-screening information, which was
            inefficient for both sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solving this on the design side required contending with a number of
            challenges.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Retrofitting Designs to Code</h3>
          <p>
            When I joined, the development team had already begun building
            Gracie‚Äôs full application process without a designer. Many features
            existed on the back end, but lacked a user interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result,
            <span class="strong"
              >the typical design-first process wasn‚Äôt possible</span
            >. I needed to adapt my solutions to fit the existing codebase while
            delivering a coherent user experience to the front end.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="stickies three-col">
          <article class="note">
            <h1>üö´üìÑ</h1>
            <h3>No Document Uploads</h3>
            <p>
              Candidates couldn‚Äôt upload documents like resumes directly to
              Gracie. Redirecting them to external links interrupted the
              conversation & increased the risk of dropoff.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="note">
            <h1>üö´‚öñÔ∏è</h1>
            <h3>No EEOC Questionnaires</h3>
            <p>
              To comply with federal hiring regulations, Gracie needed to
              present an EEOC questionnaire during the conversational
              application flow.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="note">
            <h1>üö´üì±</h1>
            <h3>No Platform Parity</h3>
            <p>
              Most frontline candidates engaged with Gracie through SMS and
              WhatsApp, so features needed to be delivered consistently across
              both desktop and mobile web.

          <h3>2. Preventing User Alienation</h3>
          <p>
            Grayscale prioritized rapid shipping, so
            <span class="strong"
              >my capacity to conduct formal research was limited.</span
            >
            But, I knew chatbot-driven hiring risked alienating jobseekers if
            designed poorly. To take extra care on the design side, I
            intentionally sought out the most critical perspectives.
          </p>

          <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../imgs/grayscale/controversial.png" />
            <p class="caption-text">
              Jobseekers' mistrust of AI hiring processes was usually rooted in
              fear of AI bias gatekeeping certain applications from ever
              reaching a human recruiter.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block">
          <h3>3. The Business Case for Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            The truth was that Grayscale took real care to handle candidate
            information securely. My focus was to make that commitment visible
            to jobseekers by advocating internally for edge cases where
            applicants risked exclusion and designing UI patterns that
            <span class="strong"
              >reassured jobseekers that every application would be considered
              fairly.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The business case for accessible, secure chatbot designs is that in
            high-volume hiring, customers need to keep their pipelines full.
            Making applications clear and accessible to as many candidates as
            possible directly serves that interest.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            I designed conversational flows, mobile-first UI patterns, and
            plain-language microcopy that reduced friction while reinforcing
            trust. These interventions covered everything from document upload
            to demographic disclosure. A good example of this work is the
            redesigned EEOC survey experience, which worked consistently across
            SMS, WhatsApp, and web.
