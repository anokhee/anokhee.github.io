          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Grayscale is a B2B hiring platform that integrates with customers’
            ATS to automate high-volume recruiting tasks. At its heart lives an
            AI Assistant named Gracie.
          </p>
          As the sole UX Designer, I partnered with the PM, VP of
          Product/Engineering, CTO, and developers to translate Gracie's
          rapidly-evolving capabilities into human-friendly, scalable
          interfaces.

          <h2>High-Level Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Gracie was mainly an embedded chatbot on customers’ career sites,
            helping candidates identify which jobs they were qualified for. As
            she expanded to guide applicants through the full application
            process, I ensured each new capability worked smoothly across chat
            and mobile experiences.

          <h3>1. Resume Uploads</h3>
          <p>
            Candidates couldn't upload their resume directly into Gracie's chat
            window. They had to follow a link to the job application, which
            broke the conversational flow.

          <h3>2. Demographic Questionnaires</h3>
          <p>
            In order for Gracie to maintain compliance as a job application, an
            EEOC questionnaire needed to appear at some point during the chat
            experience.

          <h3>3. Platform Parity</h3>
          <p>
            Many candidates interact with Gracie via SMS and WhatsApp channels,
            so both these experienced needed to be delivered consistently across
            desktop and mobile web.

              With no established UX norms for AI jobseeking, this design space
              was quite open.

          <h2>Discovery</h2>
          <div class="img-container">
            <p>
              Without direct access to candidates using Gracie, I turned to
              secondary research: job-hunting forums, candidate discussions, and
              competitive analysis for a window into how job seekers perceived
              AI in the application process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many candidates interacting with Gracie were applying to frontline
              roles where English fluency is not a requirement. This led me to
              consider how many marginalized folks may be applying through
              Gracie, and does this experience make them feel comfortable? After
              all, it’s well-documented that applicants sometimes alter their
              names on résumés to appear “less foreign.”
            </p>
            <p>
              I worried that if Gracie’s flow didn't feel transparent or
              legitimate enough, candidates might assume she was just another
              biased gatekeeper and abandon their applications altogether.

            <p class="caption-text">
              Interestingly, this take is not unusual on Reddit. If even the
              self-proclaimed “peak privelleged” don't trust EEOC
              questionnaires, that’s further evidence that this is a UX problem!

                Rather than overwhelming candidates with a wall of dense legal
                text, the survey followed a stepper format. Each step contained
                only one or two questions, keeping the interaction lightweight
                and providing a sense of progress.

                <span class="strong">Signals of Trust:</span> Before opening the
                survey, Gracie reassured candidates in plain language that
                responses were voluntary and had no impact on hiring outcomes.
                Inside the flow, an official EEOC disclaimer and shield icon
                reinforced privacy and compliance. Informational copy linked out
                to EEOC documentation for candidates who wanted more detail.

                <span class="strong">Tone Shift for Security</span> Once the
                EEOC widget opened, Gracie’s conversational voice paused and
                shifted to a more formal, secure tone. This contrast underscored
                that demographic answers were confidential and treated
                differently than general chatbot interactions.

            My design allowed candidates to complete EEOC surveys securely

            completion rates.
