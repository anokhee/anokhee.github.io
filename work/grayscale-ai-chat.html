          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Grayscale is a B2B hiring platform that integrates with customers’
            ATS to automate high-volume recruiting tasks. At its heart lives an
            AI Assistant named Gracie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gracie began as an embeddable chatbot that answered prospective
            applicants' questions and suggested relevant roles. As her
            capabilities expanded to support the full application process, I
            collaborated with Product & Engineering to translate these rapidly
            evolving features into human-friendly, scalable interfaces.
          </p>
          <h3>My Role & Impact</h3>
          <p>
            As Grayscale's sole designer, I was responsible for
            <span class="strong">all the design work</span> required to ship new
            features for AI Assistant, which drove measurable outcomes reported
            by customers.

          <h3>Resume Uploads</h3>
          <p>
            Candidates couldn't upload their resume directly into Gracie's chat
            window. They had to follow a link to the job application, which
            broke the conversational flow.

          <h3>EEOC Questionnaires</h3>
          <p>
            In order for Gracie to maintain compliance as a job application, an
            EEOC questionnaire needed to appear at some point during the chat
            experience.

          <h3>Platform Parity</h3>
          <p>
            Many candidates interact with Gracie via SMS and WhatsApp channels,
            so both these experienced needed to be delivered consistently across
            desktop and mobile web.

          <h2>Discovery</h2>
          <div class="img-container">
            <p>
              Without direct access to candidates, I turned to job-hunting
              forums, articles, and competitive analysis to understand how
              jobseekers perceived AI in their application process. I learned
              that many candidates are mistrustful, fearing it may block their
              applications from ever reaching a real recruiter.
            </p>
            <p>
              To counter this, I spent some time thinking about how Gracie’s
              flow could be designed to feel transparent and legitimate,
              reassuring candidates that their applications weren't just being
              sent into the ether.

                <span class="strong">Stepped Form:</span>
                Rather than overwhelming candidates with a wall of dense legal
                text, the survey followed a stepper format. Each step contained
                only one or two questions, keeping the interaction lightweight
                and providing a sense of progress.

                <span class="strong">Signals of Trust:</span> Before opening the
                survey, Gracie reassured candidates in plain language that
                responses were voluntary and had no impact on hiring outcomes.
                Inside the flow, an official EEOC disclaimer and shield icon
                reinforced privacy and compliance. Informational copy linked out
                to EEOC documentation for candidates who wanted more detail.

                <span class="strong">Tone Shift for Security</span> Once the
                EEOC widget opened, Gracie’s conversational voice paused and
                shifted to a more formal, secure tone. This contrast underscored
                that demographic answers were confidential and treated
                differently than general chatbot interactions.

            My design allowed candidates to complete EEOC surveys securely
            across all channels, while preserving conversational flow and
            strengthening trust in Gracie. This work helped Grayscale to
            maintain compliance at a massive scale, and contributed to improved
            completion rates.
