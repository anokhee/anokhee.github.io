          <h1>Designing a Self-Serve Hiring Platform at Terminal</h1>
          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Terminal is an Employer of Record (EOR) that vets international
            software talent and enables its customers to hire them full-time
            without setting up a local entity. In a competitive hiring market,
            efficiency is everything. Companies with the fastest, smoothest
            hiring processes consistently land the best candidates. That’s why,
            for Terminal, customers facing long times-to-fill were the most
            likely to churn.
          </p>
          <p>
            While a customer-facing SaaS product technically existed, it was an
            early-stage MVP and not actively used. Terminal saw an opportunity
            to strengthen its customer experience and demonstrate greater value
            to prospects by transforming this prototype into a fully-realized
            SaaS solution.
          </p>
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <p>
            As the primary designer on the B2B Products team, I partnered with
            the PM, engineers, and cross-functional designers to explore new
            directions for Terminal’s product. I led concept exploration and
            visual rebranding, while our group was encouraged to think broadly
            about potential product offerings.
          </p>

      <section class="fade-in-on-scroll">
        <div class="text-block">
          <h2>Discovery</h2>
          <p>
            To understand what contributed to long times-to-fill, I conducted
            lightweight discovery by interviewing Terminal’s internal recruiting
            team and reviewing internal documentation.
          </p>
          <h3>Persona</h3>
          <p>
            Terminal’s customer base was largely startups, where the person
            responsible for hiring was rarely a recruiter by trade. Depending on
            company size, it might be a founder, a manager, or an employee
            juggling multiple roles. To design effectively for this generalist
            persona, I mapped the entire recruiting journey—from awareness to
            retention—and focused on the jobs-to-be-done at each stage. This
            gave us a bird’s-eye view of what Terminal’s B2B experience might be
            missing, and where new opportunities could exist.
          </p>
          <h3>Factors Contributing to Long Times-to-Fill</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span class="strong">Slow communication:</span> Customers relied
              on phone and email, where lag times between touchpoints often
              added days to the hiring cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="strong">Black box process:</span> With little
              visibility into sourcing, vetting, or candidate quality, customers
              struggled to trust Terminal’s process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="strong">ROI uncertainty: </span> Interviews were
              expensive, and without knowledge of global talent markets,
              customers and prospects struggled to see Terminal’s ROI.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="strong">Expectation gap: </span> Terminal branded
              itself as a cutting-edge hiring platform. Customers expected the
              control and visibility of a domestic recruiter, paired with the
              speed and expertise of a global platform—something the MVP didn’t
              yet deliver.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            Because Terminal’s internal recruiting and legal teams absorbed most
            of the administrative work, customers’ pain points clustered around
            the Sourcing and Selection stages of their hiring journey. Secondary
            challenges appeared later, during Onboarding, Management, and
            Retention.
          </p>

      <section class="fade-in-on-scroll">
        <div class="text-block">
          <h2>Conceptual Design Process</h2>
          <p>
            With a greenfield problem space to explore, my PM and I adopted the
            Double Diamond method by practicing divergent thinking individually,
            then converging our strongest ideas together. Even the worst ideas
            were valuable at this stage because they solidified our product
            direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since we learned that most of the user pain points were in the
            sourcing and selection stages, the more detailed concepts revolved
            around those with some secondary concepts sprinkled in to gauge
            interest.
          </p>
          <!-- Image of Concepts Go Here -->
          <h3>Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            The concept of an advanced candidate search resonated strongly with
            stakeholders, who saw it as a solution to customers’ biggest pain
            point: lack of visibility into the talent pool. One executive noted:
            “This almost looks like a marketplace.”
          </p>
          <p>
            That comment sparked a lightbulb: Terminal’s product could be
            positioned less like a static database and more like a dynamic
            hiring fair—where candidates could showcase their strengths,
            employers felt engaged and in control, and applications never
            disappeared into a void.

          <h2>Visual Branding</h2>
          <p>
            Concurrently, stakeholders asked me to refresh the B2B interface so
            it felt light and airy, yet professional and distinct from
            Terminal’s recruiting platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            I drew inspiration from the whimsical pastel tones and illustrative
            style already established on the marketing site, experimenting with
            directions that carried that personality into the product. Taking an
            agency-like approach, I presented multiple brand options side by
            side to highlight tradeoffs in tone and usability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most successful direction turned out to be the simplest: reusing
            the recruiting palette but flipping its primary and secondary
            colors. This solution gave the interface its own identity while
            still feeling recognizably on-brand—balancing practicality with
            fresh visual energy.

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>
            The new platform positioned Terminal as a transparent, engaging, and
            fast hiring solution. By reframing the customer experience as a
            marketplace, we turned the product from a passive hand-off tool into
            a lively, self-service recruiting partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through research-driven discovery, marketplace-inspired concepting,
            and iterative branding, we shipped a solution that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reduced communication lags and shortened time-to-fill by 40%.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increased customer trust and loyalty by providing greater
              visibility into the hiring pool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Differentiated Terminal’s brand identity from others in a
              competitive market.

          <h2>Reflections</h2>
          <p>
            With so little precedent to build on, I had to balance wide-open
            exploration with disciplined prioritization.
          </p>
          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="strong">Stories drive alignment.</span>
              The “marketplace” metaphor shaped both the visual design and the
              user experience, but more importantly, it gave stakeholders a
              shared mental model. I saw how a strong narrative can rally a
              cross-functional team around a vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="strong"
                >When to use jobs-to-be-done over personas.</span
              >
              Our customers were often “recruiting laymen,” so JTBDs provided a
              more flexible way to capture their needs without forcing them into
              rigid personas—or designing a UI that assumed they were trained
              recruiters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="strong">Constraints fuel clarity.</span>
              Being asked to explore multiple branding directions was
              overwhelming at first, but it ultimately led to the simplest, most
              practical solution: flipping the existing palette. I realized that
              surfacing constraints early can accelerate the path to the best
              design.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="strong">Greenfield ≠ anything goes.</span>
              Starting from scratch was exciting, but tying every idea back to
              the core business problem (time-to-fill) kept the project grounded
              and helped us avoid drifting too far into “nice-to-haves”.
