          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Grayscale integrates with customers’ ATS to automate messaging
            workflows for high-volume recruiting. As a designer, I supported
            Grayscale's move upmarket by scaling its UX to serve large,
            data-heavy customers with multilevel org structures.
          </p>
          <h3>Balancing UX for Enterprise & MDM Customers</h3>
          <p>
            Even though Grayscale was scaling for enterprise adoption, midmarket
            customers still needed support. As a designer, I needed to balance
            simplicity for some users with power and flexibility for others,
            while preserving a holistic brand experience.

            <span class="strong">Target User Personas:</span> End Users &
            Enterprise Admins
          </p>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Customers wanted a centralized database of every lead, including not
            only past applicants, but anyone who interacted with their chatbot
            or marked a job as interesting. Since many customers were hiring for
            high-volume roles, the number of entries in this database was likely
            to be astronomical, making discoverability critical.
          </p>
          <p>
            For end users, Grayscale functioned primarily as a messaging add-on
            to their ATS, not a replacement for it. Recruiters needed to dip
            into the Talent Pool to find the right candidates without breaking
            their flow in core ATS tasks. Meanwhile, enterprise admins expected
            more advanced functionality: configuration, segmentation, and
            permissions that respected the complexity of large org structures.
          </p>
          <h3>Design Goal</h3>
          <p>
            Create a Talent Pool that scaled to enterprise data volume while
            still feeling lightweight and usable for recruiters in the flow of
            daily work.
          </p>

          <h3>Before</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Tables crammed multiple data points into single cells, making them
              difficult to scan or export cleanly.
            </li>
            <li>
              There was no search or sorting capability, so recruiters had to
              either use CTRL+F or look for Talent Pool entries nestled inside
              paginated data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Filtering used an unusual, nonstandard pattern to build complex
              queries, but it wasn’t filtering on fields users would find
              useful.
            </li>
            <li>
              Candidates could be added to lists for easier organization, but
              the list feature was inaccessible from anywhere else in the
              application.

                <span class="strong">Configurable data columns:</span> Users
                could choose which fields mattered most to them and hide the
                rest. This reduced overwhelm and gave different personas the
                power to surface only the fields they found most important
                without us having to design for edge cases based on persona or
                org size.

                or keyword in seconds.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Advanced filtering:</span> Searchable,
                multi-select filters with include/exclude logic and intuitive
                presentation replaced the old filters, making it easy to refine
                thousands of candidates into relevant subsets.

                <span class="strong">Segmentation & tagging tools:</span>
                Recruiters could now save groups, apply dynamic tags, and build
                lists to power automations such as outreach campaigns.

            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            Whether they were searching for a single candidate or building a
            segment of targeted candidates to run automations against,
            recruiters could find them within seconds using their Talent Pool.

            <span class="strong">Target User Personas:</span> Enterprise Admins
          </p>
          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>
            For context, Gracie is the AI personification of Grayscale’s
            automated messaging product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enterprise admins relied on customer support for simple updates to
            their instance of Gracie, like changing their name, adjusting brand
            colors, updating FAQs, or tweaking tone. This request was escalated
            to engineers, pulling them and the support team away from their
            daily tasks. This revealed an opportunity to reduce the support
            tickets by giving admins more power over their AI Assistants.
          </p>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Admins shouldn’t have to wait for quick, low-risk changes to their
              AI Assistant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Support’s time is better spent on strategic guidance, such as
              onboarding and solving complex challenges.
            </li>
            <li>
              Engineering should be protected to focus on shipping new features
              rather than small customer requests.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Clear Navigation: </span>Each data point
                was separated into its own cell, improving readability and
                enabling clean CSV exports that matched what users saw in
                Grayscale.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Guided UX Copy:</span> Since there were so
                many setup configurations, it would be easy for even the most
                knowledgeable admin to get lost in a long form. These settings
                required a clear menu that mapped each step to a part of
                Gracie’s behavior or appearance, so users could quickly find
                what they needed.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Familiar Flow:</span> Inline explanations
                clarified what each option controlled and the downstream effect
                of a change, reducing uncertainty.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Available Tech:</span> A preview → save →
                deploy pattern mirrored common enterprise tools, lowering the
                learning curve for busy recruiters.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Segmentation & tagging tools:</span>
                It wasn’t difficult for engineers to set permissions in such a
                way that admin level users could preview and publish changes and
                admins could act in minutes instead of waiting days.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            I designed a self-service configuration flow that was easy to
            navigate and gave customers direct control over Gracie’s everyday
            settings while preserving white-glove support for complex needs. My
            guiding principle was to empower admins while maintaining
            Grayscale’s white-glove support model.

          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reduced repetitive support tickets, enabling Support to focus on
              onboarding, optimization, and troubleshooting complex workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allowed engineering to reclaim time from manual updates and invest
              it in building new product capabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strengthened customer confidence by giving admins quick,
              transparent control while keeping Grayscale’s support team
              available for higher-touch needs.
