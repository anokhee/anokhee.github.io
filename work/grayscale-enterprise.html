          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Grayscale integrates with customers’ ATS to automate messaging
            workflows for high-volume recruiting. As a designer, I supported
            Grayscale's move upmarket by scaling several features to serve
            large, data-heavy customers with multilevel org structures.
          </p>
          <h3>Balancing UX for Enterprise & MDM Customers</h3>
          <p>
            Even though Grayscale was scaling for enterprise adoption, midmarket
            customers still needed support. As a designer, I needed to balance
            simplicity for some users with power and flexibility for others,
            while preserving a holistic brand experience.

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
        Customers wanted a centralized database of every lead. This included not just past applicants, but anyone who had ever expressed interest in a job. Recruiters needed to quickly locate the right candidates and take action on them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Because Grayscale functions as a messaging add-on to the ATS (not a replacement for it), the experience had to <span class="strong">supplement the flow of recruiters’ primary work</span>. And with many customers hiring for high-volume roles, the database could grow to an astronomical size, making <span class="strong"> quick discoverability</span> critical.

          <h4>Feature #2</h4>
          <h2>Self-Service AI Assistant Configuration</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="strong">Target User Personas:</span> Enterprise Admins
          </p>
          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>
            For context, Gracie is the AI personification of Grayscale’s
            automated messaging product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enterprise admins relied on support and engineering for simple updates to
            their instance of Gracie, like changing its name, adjusting brand
            colors, updating FAQs, or tweaking tone. This revealed an opportunity to reduce the support
            tickets by giving admins more power over their AI Assistants.
          </p>
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Admins shouldn’t have to wait for quick, low-risk changes to their
              AI Assistant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Support’s time is better spent on strategic guidance, such as
              onboarding and solving complex challenges.
            </li>
            <li>
              Engineering should be protected to focus on shipping new features
              rather than small customer requests.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
          <ul>
            
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Guided UX Copy:</span> Since there were so
                many setup configurations, it would be easy for even the most
                knowledgeable admin to get lost in a long form. These settings
                required a clear menu that mapped each step to a part of
                Gracie’s behavior or appearance, so users could quickly find
                what they needed.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Familiar Flow:</span> Inline explanations
                clarified what each option controlled and the downstream effect
                of a change, reducing uncertainty.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Available Tech:</span> A preview → save →
                deploy pattern mirrored common enterprise tools, lowering the
                learning curve for busy recruiters.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="strong">Segmentation & tagging tools:</span>
               Permissions were structured to ensure that admins could preview and publish changes quickly, reducing turnaround time from days to minutes.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            I designed a self-service configuration flow that was easy to
            navigate and gave customers direct control over Gracie’s everyday
            settings while preserving white-glove support for complex needs. My
            guiding principle was to empower admins while maintaining
            Grayscale’s white-glove support model.
