                        As a kid, Flash game sites were my introduction to the endless creative potential existing
                        inside computers. Since then, mobile-first design paradigms and the deprecation of Flash killed
                        both the cultural relevance of browser-based gaming (and my dreams of ever creating games
                        featured on www.addictinggames.com. Luckily, existing web graphics frameworks enable us to
                        create pretty much anything and make it responsive.

                        As an exercise in creative coding, I developed a face generator inspired by avatar makers from
                        the early 2000s Internet. This face generator is capable of generating an endless variety of
                        unique faces.

                        To familiarize myself with DIY hardware, I challenged
                        myself to design and develop a Visual
                        Synthesizer. The goal was to explore the potential for playfulness
                        in an arguably logic-oriented world of computing and robotics. Like a MIDI synthesizer does with
                        sound
                        samples, the Visual Synthesizer allows users to
                        twist knobs and push buttons to adjust the geometric proportions of the default face pictured in
                        Fig

            <h2>Designing a delightful face generator interface
                for the mobile web.</h2>
            <p>
                When showcasing my project on a creative coding subreddit, I got some feedback that mobile users had
                some difficulties with the UI. This is because I implemented the convenient, but notoriously ugly
                dat.GUI library to play around with facial proportions. Although its sliders are wonderful for
                testing
                web graphics on desktop, they don't carry over to a project with mobile aspirations. Without a great
                solution available, I decided to build one myself.

                    Unfortunately, Animal Crossing games don't focus much on character design, instead focusing on item
                    collection. Creative freedom is not available out of the box, but curated by collecting a variety of
                    items that appeal to individual players. Additionally, users must select features from preset

                <p>Users use the range slider to select a value. For precision, they can tap the 'increase' and

                <p>Users preferred sliders over buttons. In fact, after showing users both designs, I realized they
                    didn't like the buttons at all. When I mentioned that buttons might come in handy for precision’s
                    sake, one user insisted:<br><br>

                    <span class="emphasized-list">"I really don’t think I'll need the button. I use a smaller slider to
                        play
                        around with Instagram filters!”</span>

                    I felt a little stuck here. Common feedback I got about this feature was:
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="emphasized-list">"It’s obvious to me that you should click on the color swatches to
                        edit
                        the colors, but it took me a
                        second to get it. I worry that it might not be obvious to everyone.”</span>
                    <br><br>
                    So I created 2 more designs. Ultimately, 5/6 users preferred the original design over my new
                    iterations. Even though this solution wasn’t perfect, it was learnable. If a user clicks on a color
                    swatch once,
                    it quickly becomes obvious what it will do each time.

                    Most users preferred a minimalist design at the expense of more features. This was surprising to me
                    because I thought people would prefer having more options as a rule of thumb, but I suppose that is
                    my developer side.
                    For example, when I asked one user if she’d be happier with preset color swatches displayed on the
                    color picker UI, she said:
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="emphasized-list">
                        “I already have something in mind. I don’t need your colors!”
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    In the end, I cut this UI down to the bare minimum. A horizontal slider for hue, a circular slider
                    for brightness and saturation, and indication of the current and new colors.

                        From some research, but mostly personal experience, I found that HSB can be more useful than RGB
                        for choosing colors.
                        It’s especially useful in selecting and modifying skin tones. If you want to give someone a
                        darker skin tone, all you have to do is turn the brightness level down. Sunburn? Turn up the
                        saturation. Wanna make an alien? Change the hue to blue or green.

        <h3 class="subheading">Mini Style Guide</h3>
        <p>I wanted the UI to appeal to users motivated by creativity and whimsical aesthetics. Many of these users grew
            up with technology. Generally, this user base seems to be prone to nostalgia, identifies closely with the
            media they enjoyed in childhood, and derive pleasure from curating a personal identity online. I drew
            aesthetic inspiration from lighthearted video games and bullet journals. The style guide embodies a
            minimal, flat aesthetic with quirky, colorful graphics and patterns.<br><br>
            Regarding iconography, I found most users don't like wordy labels attached to sliders. It's also really hard
            to name sliders in a user-friendly way. They preferred seeing straightforward visuals
            describing what they are doing. I wanted the iconography to be instructional and consistent without being
            distracting. These icons describe what each slider does by illustrating the minimum and maximum values of
            the
            range it represents.
