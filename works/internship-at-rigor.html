                    <h3 class="subheading">A little bit about Rigor.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rigor is a SaaS solution providing users with powerful tools to optimize and track their
                        website's performance. Users can access metrics related to user experience, APIs, and uptime or
                        benchmark their site's performance against industry leaders. With this data, they can and
                        diagnose and repair technical issues or answer business questions.
                    </p>
                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <h3 class="subheading">A creative and open-ended assignment.</h3>
                    <p>During the concluding week of my internship, I was given an opportunity to pursue my design
                        interests via a 2-week solo project. The instruction was to find an area of Rigor's app that
                        could be improved and design/develop a functional prototype to support it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the two weeks, I presented the idea to the engineering team. The goal wasn't to
                        deliver a production-ready new feature, but to spark discussion about user needs while applying
                        modern web design paradigms to the existing app.</p>

                    <h2>Problem Space</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Reimagining the analytics experience.</h3>
                    <p>
                        After noticing several mentions in Rigor’s product-related Slack channel, I wanted to modernize
                        the
                        following analytics chart, appearing on the Results page of one of Rigor's most popular
                        features.</p>
                    <p>
                        It displays
                        information about various performance metrics based on users' custom configurations, then
                        compares each metric with its results from the previous run.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Identifying pain points.</h3>
                    <p>My first step was to identify the major pain points of the current implementation. Due to the
                        2-week time constraint, I wasn't able to conduct user interviews to understand the
                        customers' mindsets, but with more time would have prioritized this. Luckily, I was able to rely
                        on my supervisor, coworkers, and information
                        gleaned from support tickets in JIRA for insight about user frustrations.</p>

                    <p>Because I would program the prototype into Rigor's existing React application, I figured the best
                        way to
                        plan
                        this project was to break the current chart down into its most basic components while proposing
                        guiding questions along the way.</p>
                    <img src="../imgs/rigor-internship/rigor-pain-points.png">

                    <p>With this I laid the foundation for the information architecture. I listed
                        handful
                        of pain points to serve as milestones while designing and developing this project:</p>
                    <ul class="bulleted-list">
                        <li>Appearance of horizontal scrollbar when a user selects too many metrics
                        </li>
                        <li>Poor information hierarchy that makes it difficult for users to prioritize important
                            metrics or
                            derive meaningful information from the page at a glance</li>
                        <li>Unnecessary UI components, like tooltips, flourishes, and links that clutter the page and
                            distract from the story the data should be telling</li>
                        <li> Crowded layout with small text may be inaccessible to users with poor vision</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Understanding users.</h3>
                    <p>With information gathered throughout the semester from cross-departmental meetings, customer
                        support tickets, and discussions with my supervisor, I synthesized two major personas that
                        reflected Rigor's primary user base. These personas are based around age, level of experience
                        with technology, role, and personality, with a few hypothetical questions to guide the design
                        process.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Charts that answer business questions.</h3>
                    <p>
                        My favorite part of this project was figuring out how charts can be used to answer business
                        questions, rather than exist only for the sake of interactivity and visualization on a page. Bar
                        charts are ubiquitous and all this data could be plotted along an X and Y axis
                        easily, so
                        I stuck with using them for this prototype (versus pie charts, NIghtingale charts, and all the other types of charts I considered). With more time, I would have loved to have explored
                        these business questions further.

                    <h3 class="subheading">React + D3.js</h3>
                    <p>D3 and React manipulate the DOM differently, which meant I had to brute-force
                        some (arguably) icky code to build the interactivity and styling of the charts. With more time,
                        I would have researched alternative libraries or methods of integrating the two libraries. From
                        my understanding, this is a common problem with many solutions.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Normalizing Data</h3>
                    <p>At the beginning, I had some difficulty visualizing the data in a way that was immediately
                        meaningful. The data is all displayed in wildly incompatible units like bytes, seconds, and
                        counts, so what might be the ideal file count would almost certainly be an impossible byte size,
                        and would not be helpful if displayed on the same graph.</p>
                    <img src="../imgs/rigor-internship/rigor-alexa-data.png">
                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <p>After speaking with my supervisor, he suggested that the data might be more meaningful to users
                        if it was converted into percentiles based on Amazon Web Services' Alexa Top Sites data.To
                        break down the percentile ranks from the 0th - 99th, we configured AWS to generate a JSON file
                        with discrete data.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now that I had the data in percentile ranks, I quickly encountered another
                        issue: I would have to convert up to 3,860 unique values into individual percentiles. To
                        accomplish this, I wrote an algorithm that normalized those values and mapped them to a D3
                        chart.</p>

                        Working on a multidisciplinary project within a limited timeframe was interesting because it
                        demonstrated the immediate importance of careful planning, research, and teamwork in software
                        development. With more time I would:

                        When designing data analytics reports and visualizations, I learned that it’s important to
                        remember
                        that even the most experienced users of your application don’t have as clear an understanding of
                        the
                        data as you do as an engineer. While bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs are well-known
                        forms of
                        data visualization, extra care must be put in to ensure that they don't simply exist as an
                        eye-catching design component, but to tell meaningful stories about the data.Research additional
                        methods of effective storytelling with data.</p>
