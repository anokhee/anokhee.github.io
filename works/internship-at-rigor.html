                    <p>
                        Rigor, now acquired by Splunk, was once a SaaS solution providing users with powerful tools to
                        optimize and track
                        their website's performance. Users could access metrics related to user experience, APIs, and
                        uptime or benchmark their site's performance against industry leaders. With this data, they
                        could diagnose and repair technical issues or answer business questions.

                    <p>
                        During the concluding week of my internship, I was given an opportunity to pursue my design
                        interests via a 2-week solo project. The instruction was to find an area of Rigor's app that
                        could be improved and design/develop a functional prototype to support it.
                        <br><br>
                        At the end of the two weeks, I presented the idea to the engineering team. The goal wasn't to
                        deliver a production-ready new feature, but to spark discussion about user needs while applying
                        modern web design paradigms to the existing app.

                <p>
                    After noticing several mentions in Rigor’s product board, I wanted to modernize one of its key
                    features. This report displays information about various performance metrics based on users' custom
                    configurations, then compares each metric with its results from the previous run:

                    <h3 class="subheading">Identifying pain points</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first step was to identify the major pain points of the current implementation. Due to the
                        time constraint, I wasn't able to conduct user interviews to understand the customers'
                        mindsets. Luckily, I was able to rely on my coworkers and information gleaned from Rigor's
                        product board for insight about user frustrations. Knowing that I would program the prototype
                        into Rigor's existing React application, I broke the current chart down into its most basic
                        components.

                            technical experience, and personality traits.

                            My favorite part was figuring out how charts can answer business questions. Often, charts
                            exist only for the sake of interactivity and visualization - I wanted to avoid that here.
                            Bar charts are ubiquitous and all this data could be plotted along an X and Y axis easily,
                            so I opted for them during this project.

                        <p>
                            D3 and React manipulate the DOM differently. This meant I had to brute-force some arguably
                            disgusting code to build the interactivity and styling of the charts. With more time, I
                            would have researched alternative libraries or methods of integrating the two libraries.

                                    At the beginning, I had some difficulty visualizing the data in a way that was
                                    meaningful at a glance. The data is all displayed in wildly incompatible units like
                                    bytes,
                                    seconds, and
                                    counts, so what might be the ideal file count would almost certainly be an
                                    impossible byte
                                    size, and would not be helpful if displayed on the same graph.
                                    <br><br>
                                    After speaking with my supervisor, he suggested that the data might be more
                                    meaningful to
                                    users if it was converted into percentiles based on Amazon Web Services' Alexa Top
                                    Sites
                                    data.To break down the percentile ranks from the 0th - 99th, we configured AWS to
                                    generate a
                                    JSON file with discrete data.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Now that I had the data in percentile ranks, I quickly encountered another issue: I
                                    would
                                    have to convert up to 3,860 unique values into individual percentiles. To accomplish
                                    this, I
                                    wrote an algorithm that normalized those values and mapped them to a D3 chart.

                                    When designing analytics reports and visualizations, I learned that it’s
                                    important to remember who the audience is. For example, a simple solution might
                                    work best for a less technical user, but devs like having the option to
                                    configure things. I also learned that even the most experienced users of your
                                    application don’t have as clear an understanding of how the data is as you do as an
                                    engineer. Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs are well-known forms of data
