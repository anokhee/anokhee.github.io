                <h1>iLearn Marketing Site</h1>
                <div class="paragraph-spacer"></div>
                <h3 class="subheading">About iLearn & my role.</h3>
                <p>
                    iLearn is a mathematics e-learning solution for K-12, college, and in-home use. Its purpose is to
                    fill gaps in students’ knowledge of common core K-12 math. My primary duties at iLearn involved
                    testing the product for quality assurance, but I was able to explore my design interests by
                    contributing to the updated landing page.
                </p>
                <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                <h3 class="subheading">The impetus for a new landing page.</h3>
                <p>Analytics reports reflected that many visitors to iLearn’s site spent an average of only a few
                    seconds on the homepage before clicking away. We realized that this could mean a few things:
                </p>
                <ul class="bulleted-list">
                    <li><span class="bold">iLearn’s homepage was not optimized for SEO.</span> iLearn was appearing in
                        search results for
                        products unrelated to math education. It may have been attracting clicks from users outside
                        the intended target demographic. For example, college students in very advanced math courses or
                        those interested in hobby mathematics.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Users couldn’t find what they were looking for.</span> The current homepage
                        was not accurately or
                        succinctly conveying information about iLearn’s services.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Outdated UI negatively affecting the brand.
                        </span></li>
                </ul>
                <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                <p>The revamped design featured updated, SEO-friendly copy and a cutesy look that aligned with the
                    overall look and feel of iLearn's application. I even drew some of the illustrations!
                </p>

                <div class="paragraph-spacer"></div>
                <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
                <h3 class="subheading">Updated copy highlighting the important things.</h3>
                <p>During the wireframing and prototyping process, my supervisor and I tried to develop a path of
                    information based on relevance to users. iLearn’s main users are K-12 and college math instructors,
                    school administrators, and parents searching for an at-home solution for their children’s math
                    educational needs. When writing the new copy, we tried to answer FAQs in descending order of
                    importance.</p>
