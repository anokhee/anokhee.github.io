                        “Dress up game” was a label once attached to most games intended for young girls. It encompassed
                        everything from actual dress up games to home decoration games and RPGs with female
                        protagonists. The fun I had playing dress up games as a kid had a huge impact on my interest in
                        art and coding. Sadly, the rise of mobile-first design paradigms and deprecation of Flash killed
                        the cultural relevance of dress up games in a web context.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the bright side, many existing web graphics frameworks enable us to create pretty much
                        anything and make it responsive. As an exercise in creative coding, I developed a <span

                            generator</span> inspired by Flash games from the early-to-mid 2000s.

                    <h2>The problem.</h2>
                    <p>In the prototype for the random face generator, I implemented the amazingly convenient, but
                        notoriously ugly dat.GUI library.
                        <span class="bold">
                            dat.GUI is wonderful for testing web graphics, but it isn't the ideal UI solution for a
                            project
                            with mobile aspirations.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Unfortunately, designing an alternative UI wasn’t so straightforward. There was a disappointing
                        lack
                        of character designers available to peruse on sites like Dribbble and Behance. To make
                        matters worse, many of the popular dress up games on the App Store were either difficult to use,
                        unstable, or both.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was clear that web-based character designers, along with the .swf file extension and sexy
                        glitter graphics, are just another relic of Web 2.0. <span class="bold">Without a
                            mobile-friendly standard for
                            character design UIs in 2020, I decided to make one myself.</span>

                    <p>
                        While exploring popular character designers, I often felt as though the UI was tacked on as an
                        afterthought, emphasizing graphics and artistry over the experience of users. I
                        wanted to design according to my target audience’s preferences. Even if it meant continuously
                        reiterating on
                        favorable aesthetics or compromising on my own opinions about usability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To understand how people felt about character designers, I relied on a combination of primary
                        and secondary research. In times of social distancing, I couldn't schedule casual coffee shop
                        dates with friends for this purpose. I had to get a little creative. My methods included:

                                    especially true for gamers. For example, even if someone believes an update was
                                    an overall improvement, they may still strongly prefer the feature it replaced.
                                    Reasons may

                                    nostalgia, preferable aesthetics, aversion to change, contrarian personality, etc.

                                    I ended up with a lot of useless information about the preferences of various anons.
                                    I posted a thread on the Sims subreddit asking how they felt about range sliders in
                                    Sims 3 vs Sims 4. Many UI complaints related to factors unrelated to the inherent
                                    nature of the slider and more to their opinion of the game as a whole . When asked
                                    specifically about UI sliders, one user said she preferred Sims 4 UI over Sims 3.
                                    Her reason? Because there was a greater variety of body shapes available.

                    <p>
                        While conducting interviews and usability tests, I noticed generally consistent feedback. In
                        fact,
                        all but one person seemed satisfied with the final design after a few iterations.

                    <p>
                        My goal was to take all feedback into consideration to create something that worked for
                        everyone.
                        But I couldn’t justify redesigning successful features to meet the adamance of one user.</p>
                    <p>
                        That’s when it hit me: his favorite game is Destiny, a first person shooter game with triple-A
                        graphics. This user was outside of my target demographic. I had to rethink my original research
                        criteria

                    <p>
                        I wanted the character design process to be open-ended and flexible, but not without a sense of
                        order. The goal was to design the UI primarily around a linear happy path, leading users from
                        start to finish. Users should additionally have the option to freely navigate between the 5 main
                        features and their sub-navigation menus from anywhere in the app.

                        overall. Users felt good about iconography "instructing" them through the character design
                        process and the flexibility of the feature flow. However, there were a few features that
                        received
                        mixed/negative feedback. </p>

                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Buttons vs. Range Sliders</h3>
                    <p>After browsing discussion threads related to The Sims, I learned that user opinions split about
                        50-50 on UI sliders. Some users liked them and others thought they were meh. But, everyone was
                        familiar with them! With this in mind, I created two initial designs:
                    </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col" style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
                            <img src="../imgs/avatar-maker-ux/low-fi-slider-1.png">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col">
                            <p style="font-size: 15px; padding: 20px;"><span class="bold">-/+ Buttons only
                                </span><br>When tapped, the value of the corresponding facial feature will increase or
                                decrease by 1 unit. When held down, the value will increase or decrease until the user
                                lets go.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col" style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
                            <img src="../imgs/avatar-maker-ux/low-fi-slider-2.png">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col">
                            <p style="font-size: .88em; padding: 20px;"><span class="bold">Sliders AND +/- buttons
                                </span><br>Users use the range slider to select a value. For
                                precision, they can tap the 'increase' and 'decrease' icons until they get the exact
                                value they want. </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px;" class="bold"><span class="bold">Chosen Design: Slider Only</span>
                    </h4>
                    <p>Users preferred sliders over buttons. In fact, after showing users both designs, I realized they
                        didn't like buttons requiring multiple clicks at all. When I mentioned that buttons might come
                        in handy for precision’s sake, one user insisted: "I <span class="italics">really</span> don’t
                        think I'll need the button. I
                        use a smaller slider to play around with Instagram filters!”</p>
                    <img src="../imgs/avatar-maker-ux/low-fi-slider-3.png">
                    <p>
                        So, in the final design, I removed the buttons altogether. Instead of using iconography to label
                        buttons, I used it to visualize the minimum and maximum values of the sliders.</p>


                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Background Pattern Editor</h3>
                    <img src="../imgs/avatar-maker-ux/low-fi-bg-palette.png">
                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <p>I felt a little stuck here. Common feedback I got about this feature was:
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="italics">"It’s
                            obvious to me that you should click on the color swatches to edit the colors, but it
                            took me
                            a
                            second to get it. I worry that it might not be obvious to everyone.”</span></p>
                    <p>
                        So I created 2 more designs. Ultimately, 4/5 users preferred the original design over my new
                        iterations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">&rarr; Why I went with my original design.</span><br>Even
                        though this solution wasn’t perfect, it was <span class="italics">learnable</span>. If a
                        user clicks on a
                        color swatch
                        once, it quickly becomes obvious what it will do each time.
                    </p>

                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Color Picker</h3>
                    <p>Most users preferred a minimalist design at the expense of more features. This was surprising to
                        me because I thought people would prefer having more options as a rule of thumb.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, when I asked one user if she’d be happier with preset color swatches displayed on
                        the color picker UI, she said “I already have something in mind. I don’t need your colors!”</p>
                    <p>
                        In the end, I cut this UI down to the bare minimum. A horizontal slider for hue, a circular
                        slider for brightness and saturation, and indication of the current and new colors.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../imgs/avatar-maker-ux/low-fi-colors.png">
                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 10px;" class="bold"><span class="bold">A quick note on the HSB color
                            mode.</span>
                    </h4>
                    <p>From research (but mostly personal opinion) HSB can be more useful than RGB for choosing colors.
                        It’s especially useful in selecting and modifying skin tones. If you want to give
                        someone a
                        darker skin tone, all you have to do is turn the brightness level down. Sunburn? Turn up the
                        saturation. </p>

                    <div class="paragraph-spacer-sm"></div>
                    <p>I wanted the UI to appeal to users motivated creatively and socially. They range from ages 12 to
                        25. Many of these users grew up with technology, and: </p>
                    <ul class="bulleted-list">
                        <li>Are prone to nostalgia.</li>
                        <li>Associate their personalities closely with the media they enjoyed while growing up.
                        </li>
                        <li>Derive pleasure from expressing themselves and curating a personal aesthetic via social
                            media.
                        </li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p>Based on this, I designed the style guide around two main things: Lighthearted video games and
                        bullet journals. The style guide embodies a minimal, flat aesthetic with quirky, colorful
                        graphics and patterns.

                    <h3 class="subheading">Iconography</h3>
                    <p>Most users don't like wordy labels attached to sliders. They preferred seeing straightforward
                        visuals describing what they are doing. I wanted the iconography to be instructional and
                        consistent without being distracting. These icons describe what each slider does by
                        illustrating
                        the
                        minimum and maximum value of the range it represents. </p>
