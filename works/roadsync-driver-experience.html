                        RoadSync is a logistics payment software with a variety of users, both B2B and B2C. Its B2B
                        users consist of Warehouses, Carrier Services, and Tow & Repair while its B2C users are the
                        truck drivers making deliveries.
                        <br><br>
                        RoadSyncâ€™s goal is to expand its B2C user base and establish itself as the go-to application for
                        these drivers on the road. As the first in-house designer at RoadSync (and sole designer for
                        over a year), I had the opportunity to work in all areas of design while discovering ways to
                        activate and delight users.

            <p>As the sole designer, I was a shared resource across the Product, Engineering, and Marketing teams. In
                general, my design process tends to vary depending on the task and team I work with, but I used the
                following design process to guide me whenever I felt stuck.

                    <p>Because RoadSync is such a young company, there was a lot of user research that needed to be
                        done. To figure out what truck drivers wanted and needed out of their digital experiences, we
                        needed to learn more about them as people. Unfortunately, we ran into one big problem: it was
                        difficult to find drivers interested in providing feedback for us.<br><br> So, we were
                        left pondering the question: "How do you get to know users that don't want to be
                        known?"</p><br>

                            Feedback wasn't very detailed. Sometimes it was just a 1-star rating accompanied by
                            an expletive with no further explanation.<br><br>
                            We could ask for feedback about a specific feature, but this wasn't very helpful in
                            terms of generalized feedback. We couldn't use this method to get a more personal
                            or intimate reading of our users as human beings.
