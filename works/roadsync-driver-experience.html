                    <p>
                        RoadSync has a variety of users, both B2B and B2C. Its B2B users consist of Warehouses, Carrier
                        Services, and Tow & Repair while its B2C users are the truck drivers that work with them.
                        <br></br>
                        RoadSyncâ€™s goal is to establish itself as the go-to application for truck drivers on the road.
                        As
                        the sole designer, this gave me a great opportunity to wear a lot of hats while discovering ways
                        to activate and delight truck drivers.

            <div class="col full-width">
                <p>To figure out what drivers wanted out of their digital experience, we needed to learn
                    more about them as people. Unfortunately, we ran into one big problem: it was difficult to find
                    truck drivers
                    interested in participating in user interviews. Luckily, the ubiquity of social media gave us many
                    other
                    avenues of exploration into their lives and minds.</p>

                <p>After compiling all our research, we developed personas reflecting RoadSync's major user bases: truck
                    drivers, carriers, brokers, and tow and repair services. For the purpose of this case study, the
                    truck driver and owner-operator personas were the most relevant as they'd be the primary users of
                    RoadSync's B2C features.</p>

                        load.</h3>
                    <p>Carriers and brokers don't start the payment process for completed deliveries until they receive
                        a
                        proof of delivery and an invoice from the driver.</p>

                        after making a delivery.</h3>
                    <p>Once a truck driver arrives at their destination, a third party (e.g. warehouse worker) comes out
                        to
                        the dock to unload
                        the contents of the truck. This can save the driver the time and energy it takes to unload their
                        truck themselves, but usually comes at a $50 - $400 fee called a <span class="bold">lumper
                            fee</span> that comes out of the truck driver's pocket.
