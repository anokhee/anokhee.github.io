                        RoadSync is a logistics payment software with a variety of users, both B2B and B2C. Its B2B
                        users consist of Warehouses, Carrier Services, and Tow & Repair while its B2C users are the
                        truck drivers making deliveries. RoadSync’s goal is to expand its B2C user base and establish
                        itself as the go-to application for
                        these drivers on the road.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the first in-house designer at RoadSync, I've been the sole designer for over a year. During
                        this time, I've had
                        the opportunity to work in all areas of design — product, UX, visual, and graphic — while
                        discovering ways to
                        activate and delight this interesting user base.</p>

                        <p>Although my main role was in UX, I also had a lot of fun creating branded illustrations and
                            design
                            assets in Adobe Illustrator to give a little more personality to RoadSync's otherwise

            <p>I was a shared resource across the Product, Engineering, and Marketing teams. In
                general, my design process tends to vary depending on the task and team I work with, but I used the
                following design process to guide me whenever I felt stuck.

                <div class="col left">
                    <p>Because RoadSync is such a young company, we needed to do a lot of research about our users.
                        Before we could start product discovery, we needed to figure out what truck drivers wanted and
                        needed out of their digital experiences. To develop that empathy, we needed to learn more about
                        them as people. Unfortunately, we ran into one big problem: it was
                        difficult to find drivers interested in providing feedback for us.<br><br> So, we were
                        left pondering the question: "How do you get to know users that don't want to be
                        known?"</p><br>

                            <p>Typeform is helpful for getting quick opinions from users on specific offerings or
                                features. It's also a good way to quantifiably measure user satisfaction via rating

                            Feedback wasn't very detailed. Sometimes it was just a 1-star rating accompanied by
                            an expletive with no further explanation.<br><br>
                            We could ask for feedback about a specific feature, but this wasn't very helpful in
                            terms of generalized feedback. We couldn't use this method to get a more personal
                            or intimate reading of our users as human beings.
