                    <p>
                        RoadSync is a logistics payment software with a variety of users, both B2B and B2C. Its B2B
                        users consist of Warehouses, Carrier
                        Services, and Tow & Repair while its B2C users are the truck drivers making deliveries.
                        <br></br>
                        RoadSync’s goal is to expand its B2C user base and establish itself as the go-to application for
                        truck drivers on the road.
                        As the sole UX and visual designer, I had the opportunity to wear a lot of hats while
                        discovering ways
                        to activate and delight them.

                        <p>RoadSync users are required to input their signatures for various reasons. The problem was
                            that, since different features of the app were built at different times, this "Add
                            Signature" experience was not standardized across every feature.</p><br>

                    <p>To figure out what drivers wanted out of their digital experience, we needed to learn
                        more about them as people. Unfortunately, we ran into one big problem: it was difficult to find
                        truck drivers
                        interested in participating in user interviews. Luckily, the ubiquity of social media gave us
