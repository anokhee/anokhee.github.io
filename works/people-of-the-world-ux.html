                    <p>
                        As a kid, Flash games were my introduction to the endless creative potential existing within
                        computers. Since then, the rise of mobile-first design paradigms and deprecation of Flash
                        killed
                        the cultural relevance of games in a web browser. Luckily, existing web graphics
                        frameworks enable us to create pretty much anything and make it responsive.
                        <br><br>
                        As an exercise in creative coding, I developed a face generator inspired by Flash-based
                        avatar
                        makers from the early 2000s Internet, capable of generating an endless variety of unique
                        faces
                        with only a few (hundred) lines of code.

                mobile web.</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                After showing some friends and submitting my Face Generator to Reddit, I got feedback that mobile users didn't find it
                was particularly fun to play with. That's because I implemented the
                convenient, but notoriously ugly dat.GUI library to play around with facial proportions. Although dat.GUI is
                wonderful for testing web graphics on desktop, it doesn't carry over to a project with mobile
                aspirations.

                <div class="col full-width">
                    <p>Unfortunately, designing a fun UI solution wasn’t so straightforward. I wasn't able to find a
                        responsive template that fit my needs and there weren't many modern face generators available out there
                        to
                        peruse for inspiration. The haunting realization that face generators are indeed another sad relic of Web 2.0 hit me like a ton of bricks. To make matters worse, the ones I found on the web and
                        Store were
                        difficult to use or unstable, so I couldn't just copy what they did and call it a day.</p>
                    <p>I aimed to design according to my target audience’s preferences,
                        even if it meant continuously reiterating on favorable aesthetics or compromising on my own
                        opinions
                        about usability. To understand how people felt about character designers, I relied on a
                        combination of primary and secondary research. In times of social distancing, I couldn't
                        schedule casual coffee shop dates with friends for this purpose. I had to get a little creative.

                        kind of
                        had an idea of what I wanted the aesthetic and UI to look like overall, but I wasn't yet sure

                        ￼
                        I wanted the character design process to be open-ended and flexible, but not without a sense of
                        order. The goal was to design the UI primarily around a linear happy path, leading users from
                        start
                        to finish. Users should additionally have the option to freely navigate between the 5 main
