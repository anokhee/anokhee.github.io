                    <p>
                        As a kid, Flash games were my introduction to the endless creative potential existing within
                        computers. Since then, the rise of mobile-first design paradigms and deprecation of Flash
                        killed
                        the cultural relevance of games in a web browser. Luckily, existing web graphics
                        frameworks enable us to create pretty much anything and make it responsive.
                        <br><br>
                        As an exercise in creative coding, I developed a face generator inspired by Flash-based
                        avatar
                        makers from the early 2000s Internet, capable of generating an endless variety of unique
                        faces
                        with only a few (hundred) lines of code.

                I got feedback that it was not particularly fun to play with. That's because I implemented the
                convenient, but notoriously ugly dat.GUI library to play around with facial proportions. dat.GUI is
                wonderful for testing web graphics on desktop, but doesn't carry over to a project with mobile
                inspirations.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col full-width">
                <p>Unfortunately, designing a fun UI solution wasn’t so straightforward. I wasn't able to find a
                    responsive template that fit my needs and there weren't many avatar makers available out there to
                    peruse for inspiration. To make matters worse, popular avatar maker games online and on the App
                    Store were
                    difficult to use or unstable, so I couldn't just copy what they did and call it a day. I quickly
                    realized that browser-based avatar makers are indeed another sad relic of Web 2.0. </p>

                <p>After researching the target user base and developing personas to relflect it, I started sketching. I
                    kind of
                    had an idea of what I wanted the aesthetic and UI to look like overall, but I wasn't yet sure how
                    everything
                    would flow together as an experience.</p>

                <p>When determining the user flow, I began by outlining the 5 main features and then detailing them one
                    by one.
                    ￼
                    I wanted the character design process to be open-ended and flexible, but not without a sense of
                    order. The goal was to design the UI primarily around a linear happy path, leading users from start
                    to finish. Users should additionally have the option to freely navigate between the 5 main features
                    and their sub-navigation menus from anywhere within the app.</p>
