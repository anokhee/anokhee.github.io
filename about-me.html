                    <h1>Hi, I'm Anokhee ðŸ§¤</h1>
                    <p>I am a UX Designer living in Atlanta, but I was born in Botswana: a beautiful country in southern
                        Africa with
                        the 12th-worst Internet connection in the world. And I've been obsessed with computers
                        for as long as I can remember.<br><br>
                        Growing up, I loved computers for the creative potential they afforded me. When printer paper
                        seemed more valuable to my dad than gold, I made endless drawings in MS Paint. I learned how
                        to spell my name by typing it on the keyboard. I explored my love for music through a
                        virus-infested MIDI sequencing
                        software called Babya Logic that killed the family computer.<br><br>
                        I am a "cynical optimist" when it comes to technology. I believe that the best technologies are
                        those which create opportunities and enhance our real lives and relationships rather than
                        distract us from them. As a designer, I try to breathe this sentiment into everything I do.
