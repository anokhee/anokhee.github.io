              <h4>Hi, I'm Anokhee â€“</h4>
              <p>
                I'm a Product Designer who can code. I am experienced in
                designing 0-to-1 products and delivering on broad requirements.
                I've worked at small and mid-sized startups on a variety of B2B
                and B2C products. I know that well-designed products enhance our
                lives rather than distract us from them, and I try to breathe
                this sentiment into everything I do.
              </p>
              <p>
                A little more about me... I've always loved computers. When the
                printer paper in my house seemed more valuable to my parents
                than gold, I made endless drawings in MS Paint. I explored my
                love for music through a virus-infested MIDI sequencer called
                Babya Logic which killed the family computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my spare time, I do all kinds of things. Recently, I have
                been learning the banjo and trying to listen to at least one
                full album a day. I am learning to practice mindfulness and
                compassion. I have three cats and I love them very much.
