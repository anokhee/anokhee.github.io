              <h4>Hi, I'm Anokhee â€“</h4>
              <p>
                I'm a Product Designer who can code. I am experienced in
                designing 0-to-1 products and delivering on broad requirements.
                I've worked at small and mid-sized startups on a variety of B2B
                and B2C products. I know that well-designed products enhance our
                lives rather than distract us from them, and I try to breathe
                this sentiment into everything I do.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">A little more about me...</span> I really
                love computers. When the printer paper in my house seemed more
                valuable to my parents than gold, I made endless drawings in MS
                Paint. I explored my love for music through a virus-infested
                MIDI sequencer called Babya Logic which inspired my family to
                buy a new computer. I befriended people in video games, then met
                them IRL, and they didn't kill me (yet).
              </p>
              <p>
                In my spare time, I do all kinds of stuff. Trying out new
                hobbies is the spice of life for me. Recently, I have been
                learning the banjo and trying to listen to at least one
                influential album in full each day. I am learning to practice
                mindfulness and live my life in a more intentional and
                compassionate way.
