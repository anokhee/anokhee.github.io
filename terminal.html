                  <h4>Helping companies hire the right engineering talent for their remote teams.</h4>
                  <p>Terminal helps companies build out their remote engineering teams. On the B2C side, Terminal sources qualified engineers from Canada, LatAm, and Europe and serves as their Employer of Record. On the B2B side is TalentHub, a talent platform which helps customers hire and manage these remote engineers. TalentHub users are people hiring for companies like Nextdoor, Gusto, and Chime.</p>
                  <p>When I started at Terminal, TalentHub was a barebones MVP, and felt like a collection of pages with no clear purpose tying them all together. With remote hiring on the rise after the pandemic, Terminal saw opportunity for TalentHub to offer more to its users. I led design efforts to fulfill visions of TalentHub 2.0, from early concepts to its big release. This project was a significant cross-departmental effort, kicking off 4 months before its launch. </p>

              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p> At the beginning, TalentHub used an off-brand color palette, lacked a clear content hierarchy, and the user journey was unclear. On top of that, its sister product, the B2C Candidate Portal, had recently undergone a major rebranding, making it even more apparent that there was little consistency across the two products. </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Bootstrap to ChakraUI</h3>
              <p>One of the reasons TalentHub felt so disjointed from the Candidate Portal was because it was built using Bootstrap. For those unfamiliar with Bootstrap, it is easy to spot and its components are notoriously painful to customize.</p>
              <p>As a first step, I proposed a one-to-one swap from Bootstrap to ChakraUI without changing any UI or content yet. This would make it easier to standardize branding across B2B and B2C products, and for developers to make larger UI changes going forward. The devs were happy to oblige and prioritizing this work now also gave me the bandwidth to focus on concepts and rebranding work in parallel.</p>

              <p>To supplement research, I interviewed internal Terminal members. Talent Acquisition provided important context because their role mirrored that of our users. I learned a lot about the recruiting process and potential pain points faced by all recruiters. Customer Support dealt with user issues in the existing app. The information gleaned from these interviews played an important role in the discovery process during a time where we didn't have many users to interview yet. Some of the concepts in the next session wouldn't have existed at all without them.</p>

              <h3>Ideating on a Broad Vision</h3>
              <p>With a timeline of less than 4 months, I needed to create several concepts for the potential future of TalentHub, and fast. The Product Manager on my team and I worked in tandem, both of us bouncing ideas off each other with each iteration. We hadn't narrowed in on a product direction yet, so the process felt experimental at times. Sometimes product brief informed the designs and other times the designs inspired the product briefs. </p>
              <p>After we were given the green light, we used these same concepts in a company-wide presentation to get everyone excited about the future of TalentHub.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Why It's Pink</h3>
              <p>The concept designs were completed before the rebranding. I used them as an opportunity to weasel the color pink into Terminal’s branding. I was so hellbent on pink at the time was because it's such a friendly and inviting color. This got some traction initially, but we received feedback that our concepts looked a bit off-brand when presented. We had to double-down at the rebranding stage to ensure that everyone was on the same page. The pink agenda turned out to be a dud. </p>

              <h4>Creating a brand identity for TalentHub.</h4>
              <p>As I mentioned before, TalentHub's branding needed a serious overhaul to match the Candidate Portal. I'm paraphrasing, but the general consensus around the vision for the branding was: <span class="bold">"We want it to feel light, airy, and inviting. Also, B2B doesn't have to be boring."</span>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Because the rebranding was happening in parallel with so many other things, it started to fall behind. Each week, I put together about 3-4 color palettes for the larger Product Team, hoping to get their approval. But I kept getting the same feedback. "It's hard to say yes or no with so few options," they said. The team grew more frustrated with each week that went by without considerable progress.</p>

          <div class="narrow-textarea">
            <h3>Endless Explorations</h3>
            <p>The designer who rebranded the Candidate Portal suggested that I keep creating explorations. This meant filling the Figma file with variations on the same screens. In doing it this way, the idea was that at least one of them was bound to stick out as "the one" (or, at least close enough to start getting somewhere).</p>

            <h4>Cost Calculator</h4>
            <h3>About this Feature</h3>
            <p>After the launch, Terminal's Talent Marketplace would be a completely new feature. We feared that it would get overlooked without any context about what it is and how valuable it was. The Cost Calculator serves as both a reference tool and entry point into the Talent Marketplace. It helps customers understand the factors affecting the cost of hiring a remote engineer through Terminal. Based on input data from the users, the Cost Calculator suggests candidates in the Talent Marketplace who may be a good fit.</p>
