      <h1>Product Design at Terminal</h1>

      <section>
        <h3>Problem Space</h3>
        <p>
          As an Employer of Record, Terminal enables businesses to outsource
          full-time software engineering talent without setting up a local
          entity. Through its convenient recruiting platform, the top 7% of
          candidates are vetted and onboarded for customers to hire.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a jobseekers’ market like that of 2022, companies with the
          smoothest, fastest hiring process usually land the best hires. For
          this reason, customers churned when their times-to-fill with Terminal
          were longer than expected.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>
          Although an MVP technically existed, it was little more than a
          placeholder UI surfacing ATS data. I was encouraged to ignore it and
          design from first principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discovery was grounded in user research, competitive analysis, and
          journey mapping. I mapped the recruiting journey from awareness to
          retention (Terminal typically entered at the Selection stage). I also
          did a deep dive into Terminal’s “Recruiter” persona, who I learned was
          usually not a recruiter at all. Many of Terminal’s customers were
          startups, so hiring might fall to a founder, manager, or another
          employee wearing multiple hats. To round this out, I researched other
          Employers of Record to understand industry standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customers didn’t have a self-serve platform like candidates did. Most
          interactions with Terminal occurred over phone and email, so
          communication lag time could add up to delay hiring by days or longer.
