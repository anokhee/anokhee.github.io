                        <p>Rigor is a small SaaS company located in Atlanta, Georgia providing users with powerful tools
                            to
                            optimize and monitor their website's performance. With Rigor, users can access metrics
                            related to
                            user experience, APIs, and uptime and can benchmark their site's performance against
                            industry
                            leaders to diagnose and repair technical issues or answer business questions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subheading">Project Overview</h4>
                        <p>During the concluding week of my internship, I was given the opportunity to take on a
                            creative solo
                            task
                            outlined as follows:
                    </div>
                    <div class="col" style="width: 65%;">
                        <p class="block-quote">"Find an area of the Rigor app that could be added to or improved
                            upon,
                            then
                            design and develop a functional prototype of a solution."</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The goal was not to deliver a production-ready new feature, but to spark discussion about user needs
                    while accounting for how modern web design paradigms can be applied to the existing app.
                </p>


                <div class="two-col">
                    <div class="col" style="width: 100%; padding-right: 25px;">
                        <h4 class="subheading">Research Phase</h4><br>
                        Eventually, because of my own concerns about it and a few mentions in Rigor's technical
                        support
                        Slack channel, I decided to go with a redesign of the analytics chart below. The chart
                        appears
                        on the Results page of one of Rigor's most popular features and displays information about
                        various
                        performance metrics based on the user's custom configuration, then compares each metric with
                        its
                        results from
                        the previous run.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br><br>
                <h4 class="subheading">Identifying Pain Points</h4>
                <p>My first step was to identify the major pain points of the chart I was redesigning. Without enough
                    time to conduct user interviews, I relied on my supervisor, coworkers, information gleaned
                    from product tickets in JIRA, and my own
                    experiences for insight about possible user frustrations.
                    <br><br>
                    Knowing that the prototype would be programmed into the existing React application, I figured that
                    the most
                    intuitive way to plan this project was to break the current chart down into its most basic
                    components while proposing guiding questions along the way.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <img src="imgs/rigor/rigor-pain-points.png">
                <p>By doing this, I gathered the building blocks needed to organize and re-organize the flow of
                    information or sketch out modules for future iterations, as well as some tangible pain points to
                    work with.

                <h1>Understanding the Users</h1>
                <h4 class="subheading">User Personas</h4>
                <p>With information gathered throughout the semester from cross-departmental meetings, customer support
                    tickets, and discussions with my supervisor, I synthesized a few personas that reflect Rigor's
                    primary
                    user base.
                    <br><br>
                    These personas are based around age, level of experience with technology, role, and personality,
                    with a
                    few hypothetical questions to guide the design process.

                    <li>
                        Rigor's users are, in general, more technical than the average person
                    </li>
                    <li>Ideally, users should not have to spend a lot of time in the Rigor app unless they are
                        investigating
                        an issue or configuring settings
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Configurations should need to be modified as little as possible
                    </li>
                    <li>The redesign is based on a desktop-only feature, so mobile-friendliness is not a factor to
                        consider
                        (yet)

                <p>Because of the time constraint, I ended up using a simple bar chart to represent the data in both the
                    mockup and final presentation. However, it would have been worthwhile to spend more time researching
                    how visualizations can be used to answer questions, rather than exist for their own sake.

                    Programming with React and D3.js
                </h4>
                <p>D3 and React manipulate the DOM differently, which meant I had to brute-force some (arguably) icky
                    code to build the interactivity and styling of the charts. With more time, I would have researched
                    alternative libraries or methods of integrating the two libraries. From my understanding, this is a
                    common problem with many solutions.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subheading">Normalizing Data</h4>
                <p>At the beginning, I had some difficulty visualizing the data in a way that was immediately
                    meaningful. The data is all displayed in wildly incompatible units like bytes, seconds, and counts,
                    so what might be the ideal file count would almost certainly be an impossible byte size, and would
                    not be helpful if displayed on the same graph. After speaking with my supervisor, he suggested that
                    the data might be more meaningful to users if it was converted into percentiles based on Amazon Web
                    Services' Alexa Top Sites data.
                    <br><br>
                    To break down the percentile ranks from the 0th - 99th, we configured AWS to generate a JSON file
                    with discrete data formatted as below:
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="imgs/rigor/rigor-alexa-data.png">
                <p>Now that I had the data in percentile ranks, I quickly encountered another issue: I would have to
                    convert up to 3,860 unique values into individual percentiles. To accomplish this, I wrote an
                    algorithm that normalized those values and mapped them to a D3 chart.

                <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
                <p>Working on a multidisciplinary project within a limited timeframe was interesting because it
                    demonstrated
                    the immediate importance of careful planning, research, and teamwork in software development.
                    <br><br>
                    With more time, I would:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Experiment with ways to effectively display data visualizations on mobile devices
                    </li>
                    <li>Conduct user interviews and testing to gain additional insights into pain points for future
                        iterations
                    </li>
                    <li>Beautify the lefthand information panel with graphics and animations to provide feedback and
                        bring joy to users
                    </li>
                    <li>Research additional methods of effective storytelling with data
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>When designing data analytics reports and visualizations, I learned that it’s important to remember
                    that
                    even the most experienced users of your application don’t have as clear an understanding of the data
                    as
                    you do as an engineer. While bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs are well-known forms of data
                    visualization, extra care must be put in to ensure that they don't simply exist as an eye-catching
                    design component, but to tell meaningful stories about the data.
