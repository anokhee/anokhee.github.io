              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <h4>Improving upon Rigor's most popular feature</h4>
              <p>Rigor (acquired by Splunk) provided powerful tools to optimize and track websites' performance. Users could get insight about API calls or uptime, or benchmark their performance against competitors. Some users used Rigor to diagnose and repair technical issues or answer business questions.</p>
              <p>During the concluding weeks of my internship, I participated in a mini-hackathon. I was to design/develop a functional prototype to improve upon an existing feature. My goal wasn't to deliver a production-ready new feature, but to bring attention to areas in need of UX improvements. The reason for this was because there were no design or product people. The front end developers were the ones creating the UIs. At the end of the two weeks, I pitched the idea to the engineering team.</p>

                <h3>The Benchmark Test</h3>
                <p>I noticed that several users wrote into ProductBoard about Rigor's Benchmark Test. Because it was one of Rigor's most important and popular features, I wanted to improve upon the way it displayed data. The report pictured here shows information about various performance metrics. Users can enter custom configurations, then the test compares each metric with its results from the previous run:</p>

              <h4>Understanding Rigor's highly-technical user base, and designing a solution for their needs</h4>
              <h3>Creating Personas</h3>
              <p>Pulling from cross-departmental meetings and product boards, I created two personas. These personas are reflective of Rigor's primary user base. I emphasized technical experience, and personality traits.</p>

              <h3>Identifying Pain Points</h3>
              <p>My first step was to identify the major pain points of the current implementation. I didn't have the time or resources at hand to conduct user interviews to understand their mindsets and needs. Luckily, I was able to rely on my coworkers and ProductBoard for insight about user frustrations.</p>
              <p>Because I was programming this in React, I broke the Benchmark Test down into its most basic components. This helped me analyze each pain point while planning out how it'd figure into the existing codebase. </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Horizontal scrolling when users select too many metrics. Although most, if not all users, were desktop users, the horizontal scrolling was disruptive of a good user experience. Finding a way to remove this would be good for users like Priya who like displaying metrics on giant screens in their office buildings.</li>
                  <li>Poor information hierarchy makes it difficult for users to derive meaningful information from the page at a glance.</li>
                  <li>Unnecessary UI components like tooltips, linkouts, and misleading iconography clutter the page. They also distract from the “story” the data should be telling about the performance metrics.</li>
                  <li>Crowded layout with small text may be inaccessible to users with poor vision.</li>

                  <h3>D3.js and React's toxic relationship</h3>
                  <p>D3 and React manipulate the DOM differently. This meant I had to brute-force some arguably disgusting code to build the interactivity and styling of the charts. With more time, I would have researched alternative libraries or methods of integrating the two libraries.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Normalizing Data</h3>
                  <p>At the beginning, I had some difficulty visualizing the data in a way that was meaningful at a glance. This data was stored in wildly incompatible units like bytes, seconds, and something called "counts". So what might've been fast in seconds translated to an impossible byte size. These values would not be helpful if displayed on the same graph, and there wasn't a great way to normalize them.</p>
                  <p>A coworker suggested that the data might be more meaningful if consolidated into percentiles, then compared to AWS Top Sites data. To break down the percentile ranks from the 0th - 99th, we configured AWS to generate a JSON file with discrete data. I ended up with 3,860 unique percentiles, normalized those values and mapped them to a D3 chart.</p>

                <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I learned how important collaboration and planning can be at the early stages 
                  of software development. Also, it's important to remember who your users are – 
                  all the time. Working on a product for developers was especially interesting. 
                  I noticed that technical users didn't mind ugly UI. In fact, they liked seeing 
                  a lot of data and having the option to configure lots of settings to their 
                  liking. With more time, it would have been interesting to conduct user 
                  interviews or tests before creating future iterations.</p>
                  <p>I'd also have experimented with ways to effectively display data visualizations on 
                    mobile devices. Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs are ubiquitous, but extra 
                    care must taken to ensure that they don't exist only as a visual component. They need 
                    to tell meaningful stories about the data too.</p>
