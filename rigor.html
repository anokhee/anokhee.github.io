                            During the concluding week of my internship, I was given the opportunity to take on a
                            creative solo task outlined as follows:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col" style="width: 50%">

                                then design and develop a functional prototype of a solution."

                        </div>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>The goal was not to deliver a production-ready new feature, but to spark discussion about
                            user needs while accounting for how modern web design paradigms can be applied to the
                            existing app.

                            <p>Eventually, because of my own concerns about it and a few mentions in Rigor’s technical
                                support Slack channel, I decided to go with a redesign of the analytics chart below. The
                                chart appears on the Results page of one of Rigor’s most popular features and displays
                                information about various performance metrics based on the user’s custom configuration,
                                then
                                compares each metric with its results from the previous run.

                            <p>My first step was to identify the major pain points of the chart I was redesigning.
                                Without enough time to conduct user interviews, I relied on my supervisor, coworkers,
                                information gleaned from product tickets in JIRA, and my own experiences for insight
                                about possible user frustrations.
                                <br><br>
                                Knowing that the prototype would be programmed into the existing React application, I
                                figured that the most intuitive way to plan this project was to break the current chart
                                down into its most basic components while proposing guiding questions along the way.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>By doing this, I gathered the building blocks needed to organize and re-organize the flow
                                of information or sketch out modules for future iterations, as well as some tangible
                                pain points to work with.

                                customer support tickets, and discussions with my supervisor, I synthesized a few
                                personas that reflect Rigor's primary user base.

                                These personas are based around age, level of experience with technology, role, and
                                personality, with a few hypothetical questions to guide the design process.

                                spend more time researching how visualizations can be used to answer questions, rather
                                than exist for their own sake.

                                D3 and React manipulate the DOM differently, which meant I had to brute-force some
                                (arguably) icky code to build the interactivity and styling of the charts. With more
                                time, I
                                would have researched alternative libraries or methods of integrating the two libraries.
                                From my understanding, this is a common problem with many solutions.

                            <p>At the beginning, I had some difficulty visualizing the data in a way that was
                                immediately meaningful. The data is all displayed in wildly incompatible units like
                                bytes, seconds, and counts, so what might be the ideal file count would almost certainly
                                be an impossible byte size, and would not be helpful if displayed on the same graph.
                                After speaking with my supervisor, he suggested that the data might be more meaningful
                                to users if it was converted into percentiles based on Amazon Web Services' Alexa Top
                                Sites data.

                                To break down the percentile ranks from the 0th - 99th, we configured AWS to generate a
                                JSON file with discrete data.

                            have to convert up to 3,860 unique values into individual percentiles. To accomplish this, I
                            wrote an algorithm that normalized those values and mapped them to a D3 chart.

                            <p>Working on a multidisciplinary project within a limited timeframe was interesting because
                                it demonstrated the immediate importance of careful planning, research, and teamwork in
                                software development.

                            <p>When designing data analytics reports and visualizations, I learned that it’s important
                                to remember that even the most experienced users of your application don’t have as clear
                                an understanding of the data as you do as an engineer. While bar charts, pie charts, and
                                line graphs are well-known forms of data visualization, extra care must be put in to
                                ensure that they don't simply exist as an eye-catching design component, but to tell
                                meaningful stories about the data.
