              <h3>About Rigor</h3>
              <p>
                Rigor (acquired by Splunk) provided powerful tools to optimize
                and track websites' performance. Users could get insight about
                API calls or uptime, or benchmark their performance against
                competitors. Some users used Rigor to diagnose and repair
                technical issues or answer business questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the concluding weeks of my internship, I participated in
                a mini-hackathon. I was to design/develop a functional prototype
                to improve upon an existing feature. My goal wasn't to deliver a
                production-ready new feature, but to bring attention to areas in
                need of UX improvements. The reason for this was because there
                were no design or product people. The front end developers were
                the ones creating the UIs. At the end of the two weeks, I
                pitched the idea to the engineering team.

                <li>
                  Pushed code to Rigor's production application, building
                  primarily in Ruby on Rails and ReactJS
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed and implemented two new features: the Executive
                  Dashboard and Benchmark Test
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ran automated tests in Cucumber and manually QA'd the product
                </li>

              I noticed that several users wrote into ProductBoard about Rigor's
              Benchmark Test. Because it was one of Rigor's most important and
              popular features, I wanted to improve upon the way it displayed
              data. The report pictured here shows information about various
              performance metrics. Users can enter custom configurations, then
              the test compares each metric with its results from the previous
              run:

        <p class="center-text">
          My first step was to identify the major pain points of the current
          implementation. I didn't have the time or resources at hand to conduct
          user interviews to understand their mindsets and needs. Luckily, I was
          able to rely on my coworkers and ProductBoard for insight about user
          frustrations.
        </p>
        <p class="center-text">
          Because I was programming this in React, I broke the Benchmark Test
          down into its most basic components. This helped me analyze each pain
          point while planning out how it'd figure into the existing codebase.

            <h3>D3.js & React's Toxic Relationship</h3>
            <p>D3 and React manipulate the DOM differently. This meant I had to brute-force some arguably disgusting code to build the interactivity and styling of the charts. With more time, I would have researched alternative libraries or methods of integrating the two libraries.

            <br>
            <h3>Normalizing Data</h3>
            <p>At the beginning, I had some difficulty visualizing the data in a way that was meaningful at a glance. This data was stored in wildly incompatible units like bytes, seconds, and something called "counts". So what might've been fast in seconds translated to an impossible byte size. These values would not be helpful if displayed on the same graph, and there wasn't a great way to normalize them.</p>
            <p>A coworker suggested that the data might be more meaningful if consolidated into percentiles, then compared to AWS Top Sites data. To break down the percentile ranks from the 0th - 99th, we configured AWS to generate a JSON file with discrete data. I ended up with 3,860 unique percentiles, normalized those values and mapped them to a D3 chart.</p>

        <h3 class="center-text">Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>I learned how important collaboration and planning can be at the early stages of software development. Also, it's important to remember who your users are – all the time. Working on a product for developers was especially interesting. I noticed that technical users didn't mind ugly UI. In fact, they liked seeing a lot of data and having the option to configure lots of settings to their liking. With more time, it would have been interesting to conduct user interviews or tests before creating future iterations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd also have experimented with ways to effectively display data visualizations on mobile devices. Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs are ubiquitous, but extra care must taken to ensure that they don't exist only as a visual component. They need to tell meaningful stories about the data too.
