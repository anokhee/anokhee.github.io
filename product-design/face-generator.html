              <p>
                Flash games introduced me to computers' creative potential as a
                kid. While browser-based gaming has lost its cultural relevance,
                web graphics libraries enable us to create anything and make it
                responsive. I created a face generator as a creative coding
                exercise, inspired by Flash avatar makers. A few vector points
                can be manipulated to produce an infinite variety of unique
                faces, like these, which were all drawn only with code:

            <p class="center-text">To generate ideas for the shapes, I started by sketching them out on a grid. These sketches proved to be incredibly helpful, particularly when I faced challenges understanding the mathematical aspects of a Canvas function. By plotting points on the computational plane based on the location of the corresponding points on the grid paper, I was ultimately able to produce shapes that closely resembled a cutesy-looking line art face.</p>

Although I had a rough idea of how I wanted the UI to appear and operate, I was unsure how to tie everything together as a cohesive experience. These sketches helped me identify what worked and what didn't before I dove into XD to create the designs.</p>

              Once the user flow was established, I began designing each screen one by one. To start, I created several mid-fidelity mockups in order to conduct initial user tests. I recruited six friends who had at least some interest in video games to participate in the testing. After several rounds of low-fidelity testing, most participants reported that the design was intuitive and easy to use. However, there were a few features that received mixed or negative feedback.

The resulting style guide embodies a minimalist, flat aesthetic, complemented by quirky and colorful graphics and patterns.

            <p class="center-text">By utilizing an SVG runtime for p5js, I was able to export my face creations and further edit them in Adobe Illustrator.

            <p class="center-text">The majority of users favored a minimalist design over more features. When I inquired about including preset color swatches, one user responded, "I already have something in mind. I don't need your colors!" Consequently, I streamlined the color picker as much as possible, utilizing a horizontal slider for hue and a circular slider for brightness and saturation, along with an indication of the current and new colors.</p>

            <p class="center-text">I found that the HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color model was more effective than RGB for selecting colors, particularly for modifying skin tones. Adjusting the brightness level in HSB makes it simple to darken or lighten skin tones, while increasing the saturation can be used to achieve a sunburned effect.</p>

            <p class="center-text">I encountered some challenges with the color editing feature and received feedback that it was not immediately clear how to use it. Some users said it took them a moment to figure out that they needed to click on the color swatches to edit them. I decided to create two more design options to address this issue, but after testing them with six users, I found that the original design was preferred by five out of the six users. Although the solution wasn't perfect, it was still learnable. Once a user clicks on a color swatch, it becomes obvious how to edit the color.</p>
