              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                As a child, flash games introduced me to the creative potential
                of computers. While browser-based gaming has lost its cultural
                relevance, modern web graphics libraries allow us to create
                anything we can imagine and make it responsive across various
                types of devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                To exercise my creative coding skills, I created a face
                generator inspired by Flash avatar makers. Using just a few
                vector points, I was able to generate an infinite variety of
                unique faces, all drawn using code. Here are some examples:
