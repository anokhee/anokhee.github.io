              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Tourial provides users with the ability to create and share
                interactive product tours to their marketing sites. I worked
                with product managers, engineers, and the company founders to
                deliver an insights dashboard, improved form builder, chrome
                extension and integrations page.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the first in-house design hire, I had opportunity to
                significantly impact the product direction and processes,
                including setting up a design system in Figma and determining
                future branding.

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Users didn't understand how their product tours were performing, or
            what steps they could take to optimize their effectiveness. Users
            wanted to know where visitors were getting lost or losing interest
            in their product tours, so that they could improve lead conversion.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Tourial's existing insights dashboard enabled users to track
            the number of visitors who clicked through their product tour, they
            found it challenging to derive actionable insights from the limited
            amount of data provided.

          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            In order to better understand what our users expected out of
            Tourial's built-in analytics, we requested discovery interviews from
            our power users and performed competitive analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interviews were rather open-ended and exploratory. We asked
            questions to learn more about each user's role at their company, how
            they used Tourial, and who was responsible for creating and updating
            their product tours. While we focused our discovery around the
            Insights Dashboard, we kept an open mind around applying this
            feedback to other areas of the app.

          <h3>Prototyping</h3>
          <p>
            The prototyping phase consisted of several build-measure-learn
            loops. We presented prototypes, iterated on them, and then presented
            them again to the same set of users. User feedback uncovered
            opportunities for improvement and helped us decide which concepts to
            discard or explore further.

        <div class="narrow-textarea">
          <h4>First Iteration</h4>
          <p>
            Based on our initial discovery sessions, I created several dashboard
            mockups displaying the metrics users considered most important, with
            a focus on displaying user engagement data at varying levels of
            granularity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The feedback we received helped us narrow our scope and understand
            which representations of data resonated with users. Funnel charts
            were unpopular, for example, because they emphasized conversion
            numbers without providing meaningful insights into the underlying
            reasons.

          <h4>Nonlinear Product Tours</h4>
          <p>
            During our discovery sessions, we realized that we didn't consider
            how data might display for nonlinear tours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, we learned that this issue was more of a concern
            internally than for our end-users, who turned out to feel
            comfortable drawing their own conclusions when this data was
            displayed on a mockup of a bar chart. Although displaying data for
            nonlinear tours was still important, we were able to prioritize it
            accordingly.

          <h4>Second Iteration</h4>
          <p>
            In early interviews, users expressed a desire to see more granular
            interaction data, down to how many times a visitor hovered a link.
            But when presented with mockups providing that level of detail,
            users struggled to envision how they could use that data to convert
            a visitor into a lead.
          </p>
          <p>
            We realized that we may have assumed too much. Instead of focusing
            on our two user problems, – "Users don't understand how their
            product tours are performing" and "Users don't know what steps they
            can take to optimize their effectiveness" – we should have been
            asking "How might we help users convert more visitors into leads?"
