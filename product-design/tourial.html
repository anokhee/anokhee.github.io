              <h3>About Tourial</h3>
              <p>
                Tourial is a platform designed for business-to-business (B2B) use, providing users with the ability to create and share interactive product tours. As the initial in-house design hire, I collaborated closely with product managers, engineers, and the company founders to develop and design early features and concepts for the platform. This work encompassed the following tasks: 
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An analytics dashboard for users to track how users were
                  engaging with their product tours
                </li>
                <li>
                  A chrome extension enabling users to upload browser
                  screenshots straight into Tourial
                </li>
                <li>An improved form builder</li>
                <li>A scalable integrations page</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Conducted discovery interviews with users to refine personas &
                  drive new feature iterations
                </li>
                <li>
                  Validated prototypes and product requirements by conducting
                  usability tests
                </li>
                <li>
                  Collaborated with Product and Engineering to develop
                  designer-developer handoff processes
                </li>
                <li>Worked on initial concept designs & visual rebranding</li>

                </p>
                <p>When I started working at Tourial, the company was less than a year old, and there was a lot of room for exploration and conceptual work in my design role. At this stage, the product direction was broad, and a lot of research was necessary to narrow it down. I had the chance to experiment with many different ideas and directions that came to me at random times. I found that sketching and doodling were an effective way to capture stream-of-conscious ideas that popped up during meetings or other times.</p>

                <p>
                  To refine my ideas, I converted the sketches that had potential into low-fidelity wireframes using Figma. At this stage, I often included some interaction flows. These interactions served as visualizations or informed user stories for Product Managers, visualized interactions for Engineers, and helped Business Development see progress.

                  Using Figma made developer handoff generally easy, however, with remote work and multiple features being worked on simultaneously, it became difficult to track everything. To simplify the handoff process, I added design notes that provided additional details on interactions, reducing the need for back-and-forth communication.

          Tourial's Insights Dashboard provides a way for users to track the performance of their product tours and optimize them for better engagement. By analyzing user behavior data, such as click-through rates and time spent on each step of the tour, users can understand which parts of their tours are effective and which need improvement. With this information, they can make data-driven decisions to optimize their tours for better engagement.

              We sent out emails requesting 30-minute interviews from users.
              Fortunately for us, our users were happy to oblige. We used these
              interviews to find out more about each person's role at their
              company. We wanted to know how they used Tourial and how many
              others built/updated their product tours. We encouraged them to
              talk about each person's role and process. What other tools do
              they use on a daily basis? Based on this, we had an idea of what
              UI patterns they were comfortable with, and how we could leverage knowledge of the products they were currently using to fulfill their needs with Tourial.

          Users wanted detailed analytics about engagement with their product tours, so we conducted initial interviews to determine what metrics were important to them.

        <h3>Second Iteration</h3>
        <p>
          The second iteration made two things clear. We had some misconceptions
          about what users wanted and users didn't seem to know, either. In
          early interviews, users emphasized that they wanted to see granular
          interaction data, down to how many times someone hovered a link. But
          when presented with mockups showing just that, they said "I don't
          think I need that much detail!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But...Why!? When reviewing recordings, I realized the blunder may have
          been on my end. Somewhere along the line, one user mentioned
          granularity, and I took it to heart. From then on, I started asking
          leading questions like, "Is this something you'd be interested in
          seeing?" Of course they'd say yes! Needless to say, we scrapped one of
          these screens.

              Bar charts didn't accurately reflect drop-off for different types
              of tours. The graphic on the right shows what real customers' tour
              data looked like when plotted on the bar graph. We worried that
              for nonlinear tours, the drop-off wasn't so straightforward.
              Surprisingly enough, customers didn't seem to mind this in the
              interviews. To them, these charts made enough sense to draw their
              own conclusions when reviewing analytics.

        <h3>Third Iteration</h3>
        <p>
          The third iteration came about while I was experimenting with design
          system solutions. All designers know how time-consuming it is to put
          cohesive designs together in Figma without a component library. It's
          also time-consuming to create one in the first place. Honestly, it was
          really stressful!
        </p>
        <p>
          After heavy discussion with engineers, I ended up buying a license of
          the UntitledUI kit to make mockups in Figma as fast as possible. The
          reasons I opted for UntitledUI over other options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developers didn't want to use a library like Material or Bootstrap,
            and UntitledUI didn't have any dependencies
          </li>
          <li>
            UntitledUI had tons of generic SaaS components out-of-the-box, which
            meant non-designers could use it too, if needed.
          </li>
          <li>It had nice charts, and I didn't want to make those by hand.</li>
