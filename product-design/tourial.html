                Tourial provides users with the ability to create and share
                interactive product tours to their marketing sites. I worked

                including setting up a design system in Figma and determining
                future branding.

            While Tourial's existing insights dashboard enabled users to track

            found it challenging to derive actionable insights from the limited

                In order to better understand what our users expected out of
                Tourial's built-in analytics, we requested
                <span class="bold">discovery interviews</span> from our power
                users and performed

          <h5>Discovery Calls with Power Users</h5>
          <p>
            The interviews were rather open-ended and exploratory. We asked
            questions to learn more about each user's role at their company, how
            they used Tourial, and who was responsible for creating and updating
            their product tours. While we focused our discovery around the
            Insights Dashboard, we kept an open mind around applying this
            feedback to other areas of the app.

              The prototyping phase consisted of several build-measure-learn
              loops lasting. We presented prototypes, iterated on them, and then
              presented them again to the same set of users. User feedback
              uncovered opportunities for improvement and helped us decide which
              concepts to discard or explore further.

            Based on our initial discovery sessions, I created several dashboard
            mockups displaying the metrics users considered most important, with
            a focus on displaying user engagement data at varying levels of
            granularity.

            Funnel charts were unpopular, for example, because they emphasized
            conversion numbers without providing meaningful insights into the
            underlying reasons.

            Interestingly, we learned that this issue was more of a concern
            internally than for our end-users, who turned out to feel
            comfortable drawing their own conclusions when this data was
            displayed on a mockup of a bar chart. Although displaying data for
            nonlinear tours was still important, we were able to prioritize it
            accordingly.

            In early interviews, users expressed a desire to see more granular
            interaction data, down to how many times a visitor hovered a link.
            But when presented with mockups providing that level of detail,
            users struggled to envision how they could use that data to convert
            a visitor into a lead.

          <p>
            We realized that we may have assumed too much. Instead of focusing
            on our two user problems, – "Users don't understand how their
            product tours are performing" and "Users don't know what steps they
            can take to optimize their effectiveness" – we should have been
            asking "How might we help users convert more visitors into leads?"
