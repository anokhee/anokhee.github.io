                Tourial provides users with the ability to create and share
                interactive product tours to their marketing sites. I worked
                with product managers, engineers, and the company founders to

                As the first in-house design hire, I had opportunity to
                significantly impact the product direction and processes,
                including setting up a design system in Figma and determining
                future branding.

                We reached out to our power users and requested interviews to
                gain a better understanding of their needs and expectations.
                During these interviews, we asked questions to learn more about
                each user's role at their company, how they used Tourial, and
                who was responsible for creating and updating their product
                tours.

                Based on what we learned from our discovery sessions, I created
                dashboard mockups displaying visualizations of the metrics users
                considered most important, including views per page, CTA clicks,
                and form data.
              </p>
              <p>
                I explored a variety of different chart options, including
                funnel, pie, line, and bar charts, to display information about
                user engagement at varying levels of granularity. Users
                responded well to a few of these designs, and their feedback
                provided us with a good idea of which concepts to scrap or
                expand upon for the next round.

                – or tours that did not follow a chronological order from start
                to finish – because it was unclear where the drop-off point
                occurred.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly, we learned that this issue was more of a concern
                internally than for our end-users, who were comfortable drawing
                their own conclusions from the available data. Although it was
                confusing, this feedback helped us prioritize which features to
                focus on.

                The second iteration revealed some misconceptions about what
                users wanted. In early interviews, users emphasized that they
                wanted more granular interaction data, down to how many times
                someone hovered a link. But when presented with mockups showing
                a greater level of detail, they didn't seem to be as interested
                in granular interaction data as much as they were interested in
                how this data varied at different points during the product
                tour.
