            <p>
              When I joined, Tourial wasn't even a year old yet, so much of my
              design work was open-ended and conceptual. The product direction
              at this stage was broad and required a lot of discovery to hone in
              on. I had opportunity to experiment with tons of different ideas
              and directions which came to me at random times. Sketching and
              doodling were a quick and easy way to put down stream-of-conscious
              ideas which popped up in the middle of a meeting, for example.

            <p>
              For ideas that stuck, I refined the sketches by turning them into
              low-fidelity wireframes in Figma. I often included some
              interaction flows at this stage. For Product Managers, the
              interactions either visualized or informed the user stories. For
              Engineers, the wireframes and accompanying actions led to tangible
              conversations around feasibility. For Business Development, it
              helped to see how things were going.

            <p>
              With Figma, developer handoff was straightforward most of the
              time. But with everyone working remotely, and often on many
              features at once, it was hard to keep track of everything. To
              facilitate handoff, I added design notes to further explain
              interactions and cut down on some of the back-and-forth.

            <h3>Discovery with User Interviews</h3>
            <p>
              We sent out emails requesting 30-minute interviews from users.
              Fortunately for us, our users were happy to oblige. We used these
              interviews to find out more about each person's role at their
              company. We wanted to know how they used Tourial and how many
              others built/updated their product tours. We encouraged them to
              talk about each person's role and process. What other tools do
              they use on a daily basis? Based on this, we had an idea of what
              UI patterns they were comfortable with and used to.

        <h3>First Iteration</h3>
        <p>
          After our initial interviews, we learned that our users wanted to see
          granular information about time spent per page, number of CTA clicks,
          and form views and submissions. I mocked up a handful of charts based
          on existing company data to get an idea of how it would look on a
          chart.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The funnel chart was the least favorable option â€“ and not just
            because it resembled a DivaCup on Day 4. While it was good for
            visualizing drop-off data, it took up a lot of room and looked
            strange for nonlinear tours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click data could be well-represented with pie charts, but there was
            still something missing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Line charts and bar charts worked well when displaying data for
            linear tours. By replacing the x-axis variable, the same chart could
            represent a variety of useful data. But again, the issue of
            nonlinear tours came up.
          </li>
          <li>
            We hadn't yet figured out a good way to represent form interaction
            data on a chart.

        <h3>Second Iteration</h3>
        <p>
          The second iteration made two things clear. We had some misconceptions
          about what users wanted and users didn't seem to know, either. In
          early interviews, users emphasized that they wanted to see granular
          interaction data, down to how many times someone hovered a link. But
          when presented with mockups showing just that, they said "I don't
          think I need that much detail!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But...Why!? When reviewing recordings, I realized the blunder may have
          been on my end. Somewhere along the line, one user mentioned
          granularity, and I took it to heart. From then on, I started asking
          leading questions like, "Is this something you'd be interested in
          seeing?" Of course they'd say yes! Needless to say, we scrapped one of
          these screens.

            <p>
              Bar charts didn't accurately reflect drop-off for different types
              of tours. The graphic on the right shows what real customers' tour
              data looked like when plotted on the bar graph. We worried that
              for nonlinear tours, the drop-off wasn't so straightforward.
              Surprisingly enough, customers didn't seem to mind this in the
              interviews. To them, these charts made enough sense to draw their
              own conclusions when reviewing analytics.

        <h3>Third Iteration</h3>
        <p>
          The third iteration came about while I was experimenting with design
          system solutions. All designers know how time-consuming it is to put
          cohesive designs together in Figma without a component library. It's
          also time-consuming to create one in the first place. Honestly, it was
          really stressful!
        </p>
        <p>
          After heavy discussion with engineers, I ended up buying a license of
          the UntitledUI kit to make mockups in Figma as fast as possible. The
          reasons I opted for UntitledUI over other options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developers didn't want to use a library like Material or Bootstrap,
            and UntitledUI didn't have any dependencies
          </li>
          <li>
            UntitledUI had tons of generic SaaS components out-of-the-box, which
            meant non-designers could use it too, if needed.
          </li>
          <li>It had nice charts, and I didn't want to make those by hand.</li>
