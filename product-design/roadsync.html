              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                RoadSync is a logistics and payments software serving various
                customers in the trucking industry. B2B users include warehouse
                clerks, carriers, and tow and repair services, while individual
                truck drivers who make deliveries are the B2C users. Throughout
                my time at RoadSync, our main goal was to ensure a consistent
                and user-friendly experience across all our products, while also
                prioritizing the rapid development of new features.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had the opportunity to make a significant impact by focusing
                on developing the native mobile app. The objective was to
                provide truck drivers with a tool to streamline their tasks and
                payments, ultimately establishing RoadSync as their preferred
                application while on the road.

          <h3>Low Signup Rates</h3>
          <p>
            To make unloading trucks at delivery locations easier, RoadSync
            created a solution that allowed drivers to pay fees and invoice
            their employer for reimbursement directly from their cell phones.
            This eliminated the need for tedious paperwork and ensured that
            drivers provided all the required information, reducing delays
            between invoicing and reimbursement.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this, drivers could either create a RoadSync account or sign
            in as a guest. Creating an account had the benefit of avoiding the
            need to enter basic information for every invoice submission.
            Despite having hundreds of users, we noticed that the number of
            weekly signups remained in the single digits.

          <h3>Improved Signup Flow</h3>
          <p>
            To tackle this issue, I undertook a redesign of the signup flow,
            incorporating user-friendly design, informative text, and
            illustrations. The goal was to enhance the usability of the app and
            provide a more engaging and intuitive experience for potential
            users.

          <p>
            All of RoadSync's products were offered either for desktop-only or
            the responsive web, but we saw opportunity for its B2C driver app to
            be more useful to users as a native mobile app. I was responsible
            for the initial concept designs that we pitched to stakeholders for
            the mobile app.
