              <h3>About RoadSync</h3>
              <p>
                RoadSync is a logistics and payments software used by a variety of users, including both B2B and B2C. Its B2B users include warehouses, 
                carrier services, and tow and repair services, while its B2C users are the truck drivers making deliveries. During my time at RoadSync, 
                the company's goal was to expand its B2C user base and establish itself as the go-to application for these drivers on the road. As the 
                first in-house designer, I had the opportunity to make early product and visual design decisions. I also ideated and created the first 
                round of designs for the mobile app.

            RoadSync's Driver App targeted B2C customers, mainly long-haul truck drivers. However, despite providing signup instructions, we only saw about 10 signups each week. To address this, I redesigned the signup flow with user-friendly design, informative text, and illustrations.          </p>

            <p>
              We expanded our product offerings to truck drivers, leveraging the potential B2C users generated by our B2B users. However, drivers were hesitant to share information about themselves, making it difficult to understand their needs. Our challenge was to uncover insights about people who were reluctant to be known.

      <p class="center-text narrow-textarea">After conducting preliminary research, we had more information than we knew what to do with. Affinity Maps and Empathy Maps came in handy for us to refer to as we drafted a few User Personas. From there, we could jump into Journey Mapping with real, human users in mind.      </p>
