              <h3>About RoadSync</h3>
              <p>
                RoadSync is a logistics & payments software with a variety of
                users, both B2B and B2C. Its B2B users consist of Warehouses,
                Carrier Services, and Tow & Repair while the B2C users are the
                truck drivers making deliveries. During my time at RoadSync, the
                company's goal was to expand its B2C user base and establish
                itself as the go-to application for these drivers on the road.
                As the first in-house designer, I got to make early product &
                visual design decisions. I also ideated and created the first
                round of designs for the mobile app.

            RoadSync's Driver App targeted B2C customers, mainly long-haul truck drivers. However, despite providing signup instructions, we only saw about 10 signups each week. To address this, the I redesign the signup flow with user-friendly design, informational text, and illustrations.

          <p class="center-text narrow-textarea">I was responsible for spearheading the mobile app effort by creating concept designs. Our major question was, "why should we use a mobile app over a web app?" We decided to make a mobile app because:</p>
          <ul class="narrow-textarea">
            <li>Offline capability would allow truck drivers to create invoices in remote areas without internet and submit them later.</li>
            <li>Push notifications offer a secure way to update users without sharing their personal information.</li>
            <li>A mobile app centralizes schedules, invoices, and payments, providing users with a convenient and efficient hub.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="center-text narrow-textarea">Note: These concept designs weren't meant to be pixel-perfect, but to pitch to our focus groups and give stakeholders an idea of the product direction.</p>

          <div class="center-text narrow-textarea">
            <p>
              We expanded our product offerings to truck drivers, leveraging the potential B2C users generated by our B2B users. However, drivers were hesitant to share information about themselves, making it difficult to understand their needs. Our challenge was to uncover insights about people who were reluctant to be known.
