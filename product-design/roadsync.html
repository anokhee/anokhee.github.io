              <h3>About RoadSync</h3>
              <p>
                RoadSync is a logistics & payments software with a variety of
                users, both B2B and B2C. Its B2B users consist of Warehouses,
                Carrier Services, and Tow & Repair while the B2C users are the
                truck drivers making deliveries. During my time at RoadSync, the
                company's goal was to expand its B2C user base and establish
                itself as the go-to application for these drivers on the road.
                As the first in-house designer, I got to make early product &
                visual design decisions. I also ideated and created the first
                round of designs for the mobile app.

          <p class="center-text">
            Illustration can convey a product's visual identity and maintain
            consistency across many offerings. When I started at RoadSync, I was
            working part-time hours while in school. I found some free time to
            experiment with illustration styles for RoadSync's branding.
            RoadSync used these custom illustrations across the app while the
            brand voice was still in flux.

        <h1>Designing Across 4 Product Offerings</h1>
        <p>
          During my time at RoadSync, I worked across the Product, Engineering,
          and Marketing teams. In general, my design process varies depended on
          the task or team I work with, but I used the following design process
          to guide me whenever I felt stuck.

        <p class="center-text">
          With so many carriers and warehouses using RoadSync, we saw
          opportunity to expand product offerings to truck drivers. Our B2B
          users were generating potential B2C users. To deliver the right
          products to our users, we needed to understand them as people.
          Unfortunately, drivers showed little interest in providing information
          about themselves to us. The question now was "How do we get to know
          people who don't want to be known?"

              Blogs, social media, and forums were great resources for general
              research and discovery. These sources provided an unfiltered look
              into our user base in the wild. Blogs often provided detailed
              information about the trucking industry. Social media provided a
              somewhat intimate look into their emotions and pain points. Forums
              gave us a combination of both.

              After arriving at the delivery destination (i.e., a warehouse), a
              lumper comes out to the dock to unload the contents of a truck.
              Although this saves the driver the time and energy it takes to
              unload their truck themselves, it can cost them anywhere between
              $50-$400 out of pocket.
