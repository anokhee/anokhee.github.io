                Terminal helps companies build out their remote teams by
                sourcing qualified engineers from around the world and serving
                as their Employer of Record. Terminal's B2B platform, TalentHub,
                helps companies hire and manage these remote engineers.

                With the rise of post-pandemic remote work, Terminal expanded
                its B2C database of engineering talent from Canada, Poland, and
                LatAm. This expansion provided an opportunity for Terminal to
                offer more to its B2B users: hiring managers and recruiters for
                tech companies based in the United States.

                Much of the initial UXR was completed before I joined Terminal,

                However, as a new hire, I lacked some context about the current
                users and the competitive landscape, which are important
                consider when making user-centric design decisions. To quickly
                get the information I needed, I:

          Early in the rebranding process, I suggested incorporating the color
          pink into the new color palette. Although this idea gained initial
          support from stakeholders, we received feedback that the concepts
          looked inconsistent with our overall brand when presented to the
          entire company. As a result, we had to focus even more on the
          rebranding stage to ensure that our design choices aligned with
          Terminal's brand identity.

            <p>
              TalentHub needed to update its branding to match the newly
              rebranded B2C Candidate Portal. To stand out from competitors, we
              aimed for the new branding aimed to be open, simple, and
              approachable. Rather than adhering to traditional norms, there was
              an opportunity to take a fresh and engaging approach to B2B
              branding.

              Before the Talent Marketplace feature, customers could only review
              engineers after they applied and couldn't actively search for
              qualified talent. Now, customers can access a curated pool of
              talent to browse through, where they can take actions such as
              inviting, favoriting, or sharing an engineer's profile with their
              team. This empowers customers to proactively find the right
              talent.

              TalentHub's old job creation form was lengthy and unclear, so we
              recommended our users submit jobs through a Google form instead.
              However, that form was also rather lengthy and submitted details
              would disappear, so users couldn't track the status or review
              their submission without contacting us. The new, shorter form
              includes instructions for crafting effective job postings and lets
              users track and edit their submissions within the app itself.

              As a new feature, Terminal's Talent Marketplace risked being
              overlooked without context on its value. The Cost Calculator
              serves as an entry point and reference tool for customers to
              understand hiring costs and factors. It also suggests suitable
              candidates based on user input, encouraging them to explore the
              Talent Marketplace.
