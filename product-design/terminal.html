              <p>
                Terminal helps American companies build and manage their remote
                teams by sourcing global talent and serving as their Employer of
                Record. With the rise of post-pandemic remote work, Terminal
                expanded its B2C Candidate Portal, opening up new possibilities
                for companies hiring through Terminal.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the designer for the Customer Products team, I identified
                growth opportunities and led the end-to-end design for
                Terminal's previously-fragmented B2B platform.

          <h2>What are we solving?</h2>
          <p>
            Companies of all sizes faced challenges in finding engineering
            talent with the desired qualifications, although the reasons for
            these difficulties varied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Large companies, for instance, received numerous applications but
            struggled to find candidates who met their hiring requirements. On
            the other hand, smaller companies received very few, if any,
            applications at all. Furthermore, Terminal's existing B2B platform
            consisted of multiple disconnected user interfaces that were built
            on a vendor applicant tracking system. This led to a disjointed
            hiring process, which required multiple external platforms (Google
            Forms, Slack, and others) to complete a single hire.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address the need for qualified engineering talent, our main
            objective was to redesign the B2B platform. The redesign aimed to
            streamline the hiring experience on the hiring managers' end.

          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            In order to gain a deep understanding of our users' needs, we
            employed various research methods, including conducting interviews
            with both customers and our internal team, analyzing customer
            success documentation, and performing competitive analysis. Through
            these comprehensive research efforts, we were able to identify the
            challenges faced by our users and uncover opportunities for growth
            and differentiation in the recruiting software market.

          <h3>Sitemapping</h3>
          <p>
            To tackle the insights gained during our discovery phase, we
            conducted an evaluation of the existing platform. Our aim was to
            identify the features that should be retained, enhanced, or
            discarded. By doing so, we intended to develop a refreshed product
            that would offer a smoother user experience, specifically addressing
            the major pain points discovered during our research.

          <h3>Journey Mapping</h3>
          <p>
            During the research and ideation phase, the Product Manager and I
            collaborated to create a compelling user journey for TalentHub,
            centered around our persona â€“ a hiring manager named Holly. We
            carefully mapped out her experience, from the initial onboarding to
            her role in overseeing a remote team's progress six months later.
          </p>
          <p>
            By developing a detailed user journey for Holly, we gained valuable
            insights into the specific challenges and needs she encountered
            throughout her journey. This deep understanding of users like Holly
            allowed us to design TalentHub in a way that effectively addressed
            their pain points. Furthermore, by focusing on a single persona, we
            achieved a more cohesive and user-centric product that strongly
            resonated with our target audience.

          The rebranding process faced delays as it overlapped with concept
          work. Despite submitting weekly branding options, the feedback
          consistently requested more choices. To address this, the designer
          proposed creating multiple design variations in the Figma file. This
          involved generating multiple iterations of the same screens to
          increase the chances of finding the best option or serving as a
          starting point for further development.

                  When hiring managers are limited to only "Accept" or "Reject"
                  options for candidates, their ability to make nuanced
                  decisions is restricted. By incorporating middle-ground
                  options, a broader range of decision-making possibilities can
                  be explored in hiring discussions.

                  When hiring managers are given only the option to "Accept" or
                  "Reject" a candidate, they are limited in their ability to
                  make nuanced decisions about hiring. Adding middle-ground
                  options allows for a broader range of decision-making
                  possibilities.
