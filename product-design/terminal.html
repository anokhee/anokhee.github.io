              <h3>About Terminal</h3>
              <p>
                Terminal helps companies build out their remote teams by
                sourcing qualified engineers from around the world and serving
                as their Employer of Record. Terminal's B2B platform, TalentHub,
                helps customers hire and manage these remote engineers.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the rise of remote work after the pandemic, there was
                opportunity for TalentHub to offer more to its users, who were
                hiring for companies like Calendly, Gusto, and Chime. I led
                design efforts to fulfill visions of the improved TalentHub,
                from early concepts to release.

                Users knew Terminal had a databse of qualified engineering

                With Terminal's Talent Acquisition team creating all the

          Before the Talent Marketplace feature, customers could only review

          to browse through, where they can take actions such as inviting,
          favoriting, or sharing an engineer's profile with their team. This
          empowers customers to proactively find the right talent.

           Standardizing Two Design Systems
          </h2>
          <p class="center-text">TalentHub's MVP and Candidate Portal used different UI frameworks: Bootstrap and ChakraUI, respectively. To standardize branding and simplify future UI changes, I suggested a one-to-one swap from Bootstrap to ChakraUI for the MVP, leaving the UI and content unchanged. This approach streamlines the work of developers and ensures branding consistency across B2B and B2C products. Prioritizing this now also freed up my time to focus on rebranding and conceptual work concurrently.</p>

          <p class="center-text">As I mentioned before, TalentHub's branding needed a serious overhaul to match the Candidate Portal. I'm paraphrasing, but the general consensus around the vision for the branding was: "We want it to feel light, airy, and inviting." and "B2B doesn't have to be boring!"

          <h2 class="center-text">Endless Explorations</h2>
          <p class="center-text">The rebranding process proved challenging as it overlapped with concept work, causing it to fall behind schedule. Although I submitted a few branding options every week, 
            the feedback I received remained the same: "It's difficult to make a decision with so few choices. The designer who rebranded the Candidate Portal recommended creating multiple design variations in the Figma file. This involved generating multiple iterations of the same screens to increase the chances of one standing out as the best option (or at least a starting point for further development).</p>

Sometimes the product brief influenced the designs, and other times, the designs inspired the product briefs. Once stakeholders approved, we presented these concepts during an All-Hands meeting to generate enthusiasm.

            I used the concepts as an opportunity to push the color pink into
            Terminalâ€™s branding because it's such a friendly and inviting color.
            This got some traction from stakeholders, but we received feedback
            that our concepts looked a bit off-brand when presented to the entire
            company. Because of this, we had to double-down at the rebranding
            stage to ensure that everyone was on the same page.

            The product vision was broad, so there was room for
            experimentation. Crazy 8s sketching, sporadic notes, and
            stream-of-consciousness lived on my iPad and served as a reference
            for new ideas.
