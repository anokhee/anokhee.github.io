              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Terminal helps American companies build and manage their remote
                teams by sourcing global talent and serving as their Employer of
                Record. With the rise of post-pandemic remote work, Terminal
                expanded its B2C Candidate Portal, opening up new possibilities
                for companies hiring through Terminal.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the designer for the Customer Products team, I transformed
                Terminal's previously-fragmented B2B product into a
                fully-fledged hiring platform.

          <h2>What are we solving?</h2>
          <p>
            Companies of all sizes faced challenges in hiring engineering talent
            fitting their needs. Large companies received great interest from
            many qualified applicants, but struggled to find candidates meeting
            their rigorous hiring requirements. Meanwhile, smaller companies
            struggled to find candidates who could fulfill their minimum
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Terminal's existing B2B platform, TalentHub, didn't serve any
            specific purpose yet; it was basically a brandless GUI built on top
            of a vendor applicant tracking system. The goal was ambiguous: to
            revamp TalentHub into a platform offering enough value to acquire
            and retain B2B customers.

          <br />

          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            During discovery, we set out to understand why users may have been
            struggling to hire the talent they needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this, we employed various research methods, including
            <span class="bold"
              >conducting interviews, analyzing customer success documentation,
              and performing competitive analysis</span
            >. Through this comprehensive research, we were able to identify the
            challenges faced by our users and uncover opportunities for growth
            and improved user satisfaction.

            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="bold">Long Wait Times</span><br />
                Users had to wait for candidates to apply to them, or for their
                Talent Partner on Terminal's internal recruiting team to provide
                recommendations. This resulted in extended times-to-fill for
                companies as they relied on their Talent Partners to complete
                tasks sequentially.

            <li>

                <span class="bold">Lack of Streamlined Communication</span
                ><br />
                Users had no efficient way to communicate with their Talent
                Partners and were directed to external platforms like Slack or
                Google Forms to complete various tasks necessary for finalizing
                a single hire. This led to a fragmented user experience and
                exacerbated the frustrations of a time-consuming hiring process.

              <p>
                <span class="bold">Inadequate Candidate Profiles</span><br />
                Candidate profiles lacked emphasis on each candidate's unique
                qualities. Users were forced to use external platforms like
                Slack or Google Forms to complete tasks required for hiring,
                further complicating the user journey and adding to the
                frustrations of the hiring process.

                Users had doubts about the skill level and credibility of
                Terminal's candidate pool.

                The Talent Hub lacked memorability compared to other recruiting
                dashboards, and the recent rebranding of its sister product, the
                B2C Candidate Portal, highlighted the inconsistency between the
                two products.

          <h3>User Journey Presentation</h3>
          <p>
            Next, the Product Manager and I collaborated to create a compelling
            user journey presentation centered around our persona – a hiring
            manager named Holly. We mapped her end-to-end experience with the
            new TalentHub, from the initial onboarding phase to her role in
            overseeing a remote team's progress six months later.

            Once the stakeholders and the product team gave their approval, I

            presentation. These designs aimed to make TalentHub look simple and
            modern, with fun elements and lively colors. The goal was to give
            the platform a light and interesting feel that differentiates it
            from traditional B2B software.

            While the concept designs received approval from stakeholders and
            were well-received by the Customer Products team, we also received
            feedback stating that the experimental changes I made to the color
            palette and overall look-and-feel of TalentHub did not align with
            Terminal's branding.

            This required several rounds of explorations on various themes

                  I drew inspiration from user-friendly e-commerce platforms to
                  enhance the candidate search process. By incorporating
                  advanced search filters, candidate profiles, and integrated
                  interview scheduling, TalentHub transformed into a streamlined
                  and user-centric marketplace, saving time and improving the
                  quality of recruitment outcomes.

                      I iterated on a talent marketplace candidate profile card,
                      refining the design to showcase unique qualifications and
                      attract recruiters. Incorporating user feedback and
                      testing, I optimized the visual hierarchy, badge
                      placement, and content presentation for an enhanced user
                      experience. This iterative process led to a compelling
                      profile card in the final MVP, increasing the chances of
                      successful candidate-job matches.

                      When hiring managers are limited to only "Accept" or
                      "Reject" options for candidates, their ability to make
                      nuanced decisions is restricted. By incorporating
                      middle-ground options, a broader range of decision-making
                      possibilities can be explored in hiring discussions.

                    <p>
                      When hiring managers are given only the option to "Accept"
                      or "Reject" a candidate, they are limited in their ability
                      to make nuanced decisions about hiring. Adding
                      middle-ground options allows for a broader range of
                      decision-making possibilities.

              <p>
                I drew inspiration from user-friendly e-commerce platforms to
                enhance the candidate search process. By incorporating advanced
                search filters, candidate profiles, and integrated interview
                scheduling, TalentHub transformed into a streamlined and
                user-centric marketplace, saving time and improving the quality
                of recruitment outcomes.

                    I iterated on a talent marketplace candidate profile card,
                    refining the design to showcase unique qualifications and
                    attract recruiters. Incorporating user feedback and testing,
                    I optimized the visual hierarchy, badge placement, and
                    content presentation for an enhanced user experience. This
                    iterative process led to a compelling profile card in the
                    final MVP, increasing the chances of successful
                    candidate-job matches.

                    When hiring managers are limited to only "Accept" or
                    "Reject" options for candidates, their ability to make
                    nuanced decisions is restricted. By incorporating
                    middle-ground options, a broader range of decision-making
                    possibilities can be explored in hiring discussions.

                    When hiring managers are given only the option to "Accept"
