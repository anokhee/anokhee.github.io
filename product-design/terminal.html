        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <h2>Designing TalentHub 2.0</h2>
        <p>
          Terminal helps companies build out their remote teams by sourcing
          qualified engineers from around the world and serving as their
          Employer of Record. Terminal's B2B platform, TalentHub, helps
          customers hire and manage these remote engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the rise of remote work after the pandemic, there was opportunity
          for TalentHub to offer more to its users, who were hiring for
          companies like Calendly, Gusto, and Chime. I led design efforts to
          fulfill visions of the improved TalentHub, from early concepts to
          release.

          Users had no idea what it meant for Terminal to have a database

            <h3>Interviewing & Brainstorming</h3>
            <p>
              During the early days of my role at Terminal, I had little context
              on the day-to-day of a recruiter. So, to get clarity around
              problems with TalentHub, I interviewed several internal Terminal
              members.
            </p>

            <p>
              Talent Acquisition provided important insight because their role
              mirrored that of our users. I learned a lot about the recruiting
              process and potential pain points faced by all recruiters.
              Customer Support dealt with user issues in the existing app. These
              interviews played important role in the discovery process during a
              time where we didn't have many end users to interview yet.

            <h3>Standardizing B2B & B2C Design Systems</h3>
            <p>
              TalentHub was built using Bootstrap, a frontend library with
              components notoriously painful to customize.
            </p>
            <p>
              I proposed a one-to-one swap from Bootstrap to ChakraUI (used by
              the Candidate Portal) without changing any UI or content yet. This
              would make it easier to standardize branding across B2B and B2C
              products, and for developers to make larger UI changes going
              forward. The devs were happy to oblige and prioritizing this work
              now also gave me the bandwidth to focus on concepts and rebranding
              work in parallel.

            <h3>Ideating on a Broad Vision</h3>
            <p>
              While creating concepts, my Product Manager and I worked in
              tandem, both of us bouncing ideas off each other with each
              iteration. We hadn't narrowed in on a product direction yet, so
              the process felt experimental at times. Sometimes product brief
              informed the designs and other times the designs inspired the
              product briefs. Once we got the green light, we used these
              concepts in a company-wide presentation to get everyone excited
              about the future of TalentHub.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3>A Note About the Pink</h3>
            <p>
              The concept designs were completed before the rebranding. I used
              them as an opportunity to weasel the color pink into Terminal’s
              branding. I was so hellbent on pink at the time was because it's
              such a friendly and inviting color. This got some traction
              initially, but we received feedback that our concepts looked a bit
              off-brand when presented. We had to double-down at the rebranding
              stage to ensure that everyone was on the same page. The pink
              agenda turned out to be a dud.

        <h3>Visual Rebranding</h3>
        <p>
          As I mentioned before, TalentHub's branding needed a serious overhaul
          to match the Candidate Portal. I'm paraphrasing, but the general
          consensus around the vision for the branding was: "We want it to feel
          light, airy, and inviting." and "B2B doesn't have to be boring!"

          <div>
            <h3>Endless Explorations</h3>
            <p>
              Because the rebranding was happening in parallel with the concept
              work, it started falling behind. Each week, I put together a few
              options, but I got the same feedback: "It's hard to say yes or no
              with so few options".
            </p>
            <p>
              The team grew more frustrated with each week that went by. The
              designer who rebranded the Candidate Portal suggested that I keep
              creating explorations. This meant filling the Figma file with
              variations on the same screens. In doing it this way, the idea was
              that at least one of them was bound to stick out as "the one" (or,
              at least close enough to start getting somewhere).

        <p>
          TalentHub's existing Job Creation form was long and confusing. So much
          so that we encouraged customers to use a Google form instead. While
          convenient, the form and all its details disappeared once a user hit
          "Submit". Users had no way to review what they'd submitted or checking
          on its status without reaching out to Terminal. The new Job Creation
          form is much shorter and provides instructions to help users write a
          good job posting. Users could track their job submission status in the
          app, and even review or edit their submissions.

          <p>
            After the launch, Terminal's Talent Marketplace would be a
            completely new feature. We feared that it would get overlooked
            without any context about what it is and how valuable it was. The
            Cost Calculator serves as both a reference tool and entry point into
            the Talent Marketplace. It helps customers understand the factors
            affecting the cost of hiring a remote engineer through Terminal.
            Based on input data from the users, the Cost Calculator suggests
            candidates in the Talent Marketplace who may be a good fit.
