              <h3>About Terminal</h3>
              <p>
                Terminal helps companies build out their remote teams by
                sourcing qualified engineers from around the world and serving
                as their Employer of Record. Terminal's B2B platform, TalentHub,
                helps customers hire and manage these remote engineers.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the rise of remote work after the pandemic, there was
                opportunity for TalentHub to offer more to its users, who were
                hiring for companies like Calendly, Gusto, and Chime. I led
                design efforts to fulfill visions of the improved TalentHub,
                from early concepts to release.
              </p>

                With Terminal's Talent Acquisition team creating all the

              I learned a lot about the recruiting process by interviewing

              Customer Support dealt firsthand with user issues in the app, so
              they quickly got me up to speed about existing pain points. These
              interviews played an important role in the discovery process
              before we had end users to interview.

              The product vision was broad, so there was room for

              stream-of-consciousness lived on my iPad and served as a reference
              for new ideas.

            <p>
              TalentHub's MVP used Bootstrap while the Candidate Portal used
              ChakraUI. As a first step, I proposed a one-to-one swap to
              ChakraUI without changing any of the UI or content yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              This would make it easier to standardize branding across B2B and
              B2C products, and for developers to make larger UI changes going
              forward. Prioritizing this work now also gave me the bandwidth to
              focus on concepts and rebranding work in parallel.

          My Product Manager and I worked in tandem to create concepts, bouncing
          ideas off each other with each iteration. We hadn't narrowed down a
          product direction yet, so the process felt experimental at times.
          Sometimes product brief informed the designs and other times the
          designs inspired the product briefs. Once stakeholders gave us the
          green light, we used these concepts in an All-Hands presentation to
          get everyone excited.

          I used the concepts as an opportunity to push the color pink into
          Terminal’s branding because it's such a friendly and inviting color.
          This got some traction from stakeholders, but we received feedback
          that our concepts looked a bit off-brand when presented to the entire
          company. Because of this, we had to double-down at the rebranding
          stage to ensure that everyone was on the same page.

          As I mentioned before, TalentHub's branding needed a serious overhaul
          to match the Candidate Portal. I'm paraphrasing, but the general
          consensus around the vision for the branding was: "We want it to feel
          light, airy, and inviting." and "B2B doesn't have to be boring!"

          The team grew more frustrated with each week that went by. Because the
          rebranding was happening in parallel with the concept work, it started
          falling behind. Each week, I put together a few options, but I got the
          same feedback: "It's hard to say yes or no with so few options".

              The designer who rebranded the Candidate Portal suggested that I
              keep creating explorations. This meant filling the Figma file with
              variations on the same screens. In doing it this way, the idea was
              that at least one of them was bound to stick out as "the one" (or,
              at least close enough to start getting somewhere).

          The TalentHub dashboard was new. I proposed this as a solution to
          users being unable to discern the happy path at a glance. All the most
          important actions would be immediately visible, in priority order and
          in a to-do list format.

        <p class="center-text">
          TalentHub's existing Job Creation form was long and confusing. So much
          so that we encouraged customers to use a Google form instead. While
          convenient, the form and all its details disappeared once a user hit
          "Submit". Users had no way to review what they'd submitted or checking
          on its status without reaching out to Terminal. The new Job Creation
          form is much shorter and provides instructions to help users write a
          good job posting. Users could track their job submission status in the
          app, and even review or edit their submissions.

          <p class="center-text">
            After the launch, Terminal's Talent Marketplace would be a
            completely new feature. We feared that it would get overlooked
            without any context about what it is and how valuable it was. The
            Cost Calculator serves as both a reference tool and entry point into
            the Talent Marketplace. It helps customers understand the factors
            affecting the cost of hiring a remote engineer through Terminal.
            Based on input data from the users, the Cost Calculator suggests
            candidates in the Talent Marketplace who may be a good fit.
