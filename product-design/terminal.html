              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Terminal helps American companies build and manage their remote
                teams by sourcing global talent and serving as their Employer of
                Record. With the rise of post-pandemic remote work, Terminal
                expanded its B2C Candidate Portal, opening up new possibilities
                for companies hiring through Terminal.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the designer for the Customer Products team, I identified
                growth opportunities and led the end-to-end design for
                Terminal's previously-fragmented B2B platform.

          <h2>What are we solving?</h2>
          <p>
            We learned that
            <span class="bold"
              >companies of all sizes faced challenges in finding engineering
              talent with the desired qualifications. </span
            >Large companies received numerous applications, but struggled to
            find candidates meeting their rigorous hiring requirements. Smaller
            companies, meanwhile, received few, if any, applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Terminal's existing B2B hiring platform, TalentHub, was basically a
            GUI built on top of a vendor applicant tracking system, and users
            were linked to external platforms to complete all the tasks needed
            to complete one single hire. This resulted in a disjointed user
            journey and time-consuming hiring process.

          <h3>Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            In order to gain a deep understanding of our users' needs, we
            employed various research methods. These methods included
            <span class="bold"
              >conducting interviews, analyzing customer success documentation,
              and performing competitive analysis</span
            >. Through these comprehensive research efforts, we were able to
            identify the challenges faced by our users and uncover opportunities
            for growth.

        <div class="narrow-textarea">
          <h3>Sitemapping</h3>
          <p>
            To begin, we conducted an evaluation of the existing platform. We
            used a sitemap to see how all the pages connected and decide which
            should be retained, enhanced, or discarded. The goal was to develop
            a refreshed product that would offer a smoother user experience by
            specifically addressing the major pain points discovered during our
            research.

          <h3>User Journey Presentation</h3>
          <p>
            Next, the Product Manager and I collaborated to create a compelling
            user journey for TalentHub, centered around our persona â€“ a hiring
            manager named Holly. We carefully mapped out her experience, from
            the initial onboarding to her role in overseeing a remote team's
            progress six months later.
          </p>
          <p>
            By developing a detailed user journey, we gained valuable insights
            into the specific challenges and needs she encountered throughout
            her journey, enabling us to design TalentHub in a way that
            effectively addressed their pain points.
          </p>
          <p>
            We turned this user journey into a presentation for a company-wide
            All Hands to get everyone excited about the new-and-improved
            TalentHub.

          <h3>Concept Designs</h3>
          <p>
            To supplement our user journey presentation and get the OK from
            stakeholders about our design direction, I created concept designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I explored a vibrant color palette to bring lightness and
            personality to TalentHub, aiming to break the mold of traditional
            B2B platforms. To differentiate TalentHub from its sister B2C
            platform, I incorporated a pink color into Terminal's branding. By
            thoughtfully selecting and integrating this new color, my goal was
            to create a visually distinctive and engaging experience for
            TalentHub users.

          <h3>Color Palette Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Although our concept designs got the "OK" from stakeholders, and we
            liked the ideas very much between the Customer Products team, we
            received some feedback saying that the experimental changes I had
            made to the color palette and general look-and-feel of TalentHub
            didn't fit Terminal's overall branding.
          </p>

          <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
          <p>
            I iterated on a talent marketplace candidate profile card, refining
            the design to showcase unique qualifications and attract recruiters.
            Incorporating user feedback and testing, I optimized the visual
            hierarchy, badge placement, and content presentation for an enhanced
            user experience. This iterative process led to a compelling profile
            card in the final MVP, increasing the chances of successful
            candidate-job matches.

            Upgrading our MVP's components from Bootstrap to ChakraUI brought
            multiple benefits for future front-end changes. ChakraUI's
            streamlined and flexible framework simplified modifying and
            enhancing the user interface. With its extensive component library
            and focus on reusability, our team efficiently made adjustments and
            additions, ensuring a smoother and consistent user experience. This
            upgrade improved our responsiveness to evolving design requirements
            and boosted overall maintainability and scalability.

          The rebranding process faced delays as it overlapped with concept
          work. Despite submitting weekly branding options, the feedback
          consistently requested more choices. To address this, the designer
          proposed creating multiple design variations in the Figma file. This
          involved generating multiple iterations of the same screens to
          increase the chances of finding the best option or serving as a
          starting point for further development.

                  Due to its low priority, the released Candidate Profile didn't
                  deviate significantly from the original. Given more time, I
                  would have aligned the design more closely with the concept,
                  which aimed to acknowledge the intricate nature of evaluating
                  job candidates. Nevertheless, these improvements were
