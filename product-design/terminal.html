              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Terminal helps American companies build and manage their remote
                teams by sourcing global talent and serving as their Employer of
                Record. With the rise of post-pandemic remote work, Terminal
                expanded its B2C Candidate Portal, opening up new possibilities
                for companies hiring through Terminal.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the designer for the Customer Products team, I identified
                growth opportunities and led the end-to-end design for
                Terminal's previously-fragmented B2B platform.

          <h2>What are we solving?</h2>
          <p>
            We learned that
            <span class="bold"
              >companies of all sizes faced challenges in hiring engineering
              talent fitting their needs. </span
            >Large companies received numerous applications, but struggled to
            find candidates meeting their rigorous hiring requirements. Smaller
            companies, meanwhile, received few, if any, applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Terminal's existing B2B hiring platform, TalentHub, did not serve
            any specific purpose yet; it was more like a brandless GUI built on
            top of a vendor applicant tracking system. Additionally, there was
            no streamlined channel of communication between users and their
            Talent Partners (Terminal's internal recruiting team) and users were
            linked to external platforms to complete all the tasks needed to
            complete one single hire. This resulted in a disjointed user journey
            and time-consuming hiring process.

            In order to gain an even deeper understanding of our users' needs,
            we employed various research methods. These methods included

            Before putting pen to paper, I conducted an evaluation of the

            existing pages connected and decide what could be retained,
            enhanced, or discarded.

            Next, the Product Manager and I collaborated to create a compelling
            user journey presentation centered around our persona â€“ a hiring
            manager named Holly. We mapped her end-to-end experience with the
            new TalentHub, from the initial onboarding phase to her role in
            overseeing a remote team's progress six months later.

            Once the stakeholders and the product team gave their approval, I
            completed the concept designs to go along with the user journey
            presentation. These designs aimed to make TalentHub look simple and
            modern, with fun elements and lively colors. The goal was to give
            the platform a light and interesting feel, different from the usual
            business-to-business style.

          <p>
            While the concept designs received approval from stakeholders and
            were well-received by the Customer Products team, we also received
            feedback stating that the experimental changes I made to the color
            palette and overall look-and-feel of TalentHub did not align with
            Terminal's branding.

            Upgrading our MVP's components from Bootstrap to ChakraUI brought
            multiple benefits for future front-end changes. ChakraUI's
            streamlined and flexible framework simplified modifying and

            and focus on reusability, our team efficiently made adjustments and

            upgrade improved our responsiveness to evolving design requirements
            and boosted overall maintainability and scalability.

          The rebranding process faced delays as it overlapped with concept
          work. Despite submitting weekly branding options, the feedback
          consistently requested more choices. To address this, the designer
          proposed creating multiple design variations in the Figma file. This
          involved generating multiple iterations of the same screens to
          increase the chances of finding the best option or serving as a
          starting point for further development.

                  I drew inspiration from user-friendly e-commerce platforms to
                  enhance the candidate search process. By incorporating
                  advanced search filters, candidate profiles, and integrated
                  interview scheduling, TalentHub transformed into a streamlined
                  and user-centric marketplace, saving time and improving the
                  quality of recruitment outcomes.

                      I iterated on a talent marketplace candidate profile card,
                      refining the design to showcase unique qualifications and
                      attract recruiters. Incorporating user feedback and
                      testing, I optimized the visual hierarchy, badge
                      placement, and content presentation for an enhanced user
                      experience. This iterative process led to a compelling
                      profile card in the final MVP, increasing the chances of
                      successful candidate-job matches.

                      When hiring managers are limited to only "Accept" or
                      "Reject" options for candidates, their ability to make
                      nuanced decisions is restricted. By incorporating
                      middle-ground options, a broader range of decision-making
                      possibilities can be explored in hiring discussions.

                    <p>
                      When hiring managers are given only the option to "Accept"
                      or "Reject" a candidate, they are limited in their ability
                      to make nuanced decisions about hiring. Adding
                      middle-ground options allows for a broader range of
                      decision-making possibilities.

              <p>
                I drew inspiration from user-friendly e-commerce platforms to
                enhance the candidate search process. By incorporating advanced
                search filters, candidate profiles, and integrated interview
                scheduling, TalentHub transformed into a streamlined and
                user-centric marketplace, saving time and improving the quality
                of recruitment outcomes.

                    I iterated on a talent marketplace candidate profile card,
                    refining the design to showcase unique qualifications and
                    attract recruiters. Incorporating user feedback and testing,
                    I optimized the visual hierarchy, badge placement, and
                    content presentation for an enhanced user experience. This
                    iterative process led to a compelling profile card in the
                    final MVP, increasing the chances of successful
                    candidate-job matches.

                    When hiring managers are limited to only "Accept" or
                    "Reject" options for candidates, their ability to make
                    nuanced decisions is restricted. By incorporating
                    middle-ground options, a broader range of decision-making
                    possibilities can be explored in hiring discussions.

                    When hiring managers are given only the option to "Accept"
