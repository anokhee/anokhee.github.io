            <h4>
              Designing & developing a responsive avatar maker<br />using

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              As a kid, Flash games were my introduction to the endless creative
              potential existing inside computers. Unfortunately, it's not 2006
              anymore. The cultural relevance of browser-based gaming died along
              with and my dreams of ever making it big on AddictingGames.com.
              Luckily, existing web graphics libraries empower us to create
              whatever we want and make it responsive. As an exercise in
              creative coding, I wrote code for a face generator inspired by
              Flash avatar makers. Manipulating only a handful of vector points
              can generate endless unique faces, like these.

              <h3>Why I Built It</h3>
              <p>
                After posting my face generator on a creative coding subreddit,
                I got some feedback that it was difficult to use. This is
                because I implemented it with the convenient, but notoriously
                ugly dat.GUI library. Although it's wonderful for testing web
                graphics during development, it can be a bit finicky to play
                with. Also, it doesn't carry over to a project with mobile
                aspirations. Without a great solution available, I decided to
                build one myself.

              <p>
                I started out with a base face, pictured in the GIF here. Using
                functions of the HTML Canvas API, the base face is drawn using
                some Bezier curves and ellipses. The red dots demarcate the
                Bezier control points for the head shape.

            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <p>
              Because this was a personal project and there was no formal
              process or deadline, these early sketches informed the final
              designs in a big way. I had a rough idea of how I wanted the UI to
              look and function, but I wasn't yet sure of how it'd all fit
              together as an experience.

                I continued to sketch the beginnings of the interactions. First,
                I outlined which actions should be the "primary" actions, then
                broke them down from there. From there, I started exploring edge
                cases. I wanted the user journey to be open-ended and flexible,
                but with a clear happy path.

                After determining the user flow, I started designing making
                screens one by one. I put together a few mid-fidelity mockups to
                conduct initial user tests with 6 friends, all interested at
                least a little bit in video games. After several iterations of
                low-fidelity testing, participants said most of the design made
                sense. But there were a few features that received
                mixed/negative feedback.

                I wanted the UI to appeal to people motivated by creativity and
                whimsical aesthetics. I drew aesthetic inspiration from
                lighthearted video games and bullet journals. The style guide
                embodies a minimal, flat aesthetic with quirky, colorful
                graphics and patterns.

              <p>
                I found an SVG runtime for p5js which enabled me to export my
                face creations, and edit them in Adobe Illustrator. This cut
                down the amount of time it would take to hand-draw each icon
                considerably. I could take a face and deconstruct it to create
                individual icons.

                Most users preferred a minimalist design at the expense of more
                features. When I asked one user if she’d prefer preset color
                swatches, she said: “I already have something in mind. I don’t
                need your colors!” In the end, I made the color picker as simple
                as possible. A horizontal slider for hue, a circular slider for
                brightness and saturation, and indication of the current and new
                colors.

                I found that the HSB color model was be more useful than RGB for
                choosing colors. It’s especially useful in selecting and
                modifying skin tones. To give someone a darker skin tone, all
                you have to do is turn the brightness level down. Or, for a
                sunburn: turn up the saturation.

                I felt a little stuck here. Feedback I got about this feature
                was: "It’s obvious to me that you should click on the color
                swatches to edit the colors, but it took me a second to get it.
                I worry that it might not be obvious to everyone.” So I created
                2 more designs. Five out of the six users preferred the original
                design over my new iterations. Even though this solution wasn’t
                perfect, it was learnable. If a user clicks on a color swatch
                once, it becomes obvious what it will do each time.
