                        Appalachian romanticism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In northern Georgia, bordering the Carolinas, the Blue Ridge mountains hug the horizon from
                        almost every angle. In
                        sparsely-populated small
                        towns dotted by pastures, warehouses, and gas
                        stations, the snug adjacency to these mountains can evoke a certain emotional affect. Depending
                        on the time of day, weather, viewing angle, or even personal mood, the landscapes sometimes
                        seem to shapeshift
                        accordingly. Whether that leads to daydreams of an agrarian life in
                        pre-colonial America or scenes from <span class="italics">Deliverance</span> is variable, but
                        interesting.

                <div class="column-full">
                    <p> I felt inclined to somehow artistically express this phenomenon. I've always loved
                        subtle patterns in nature like those expressed by the unfurling of plants or drawn
                        onto the delicate wings of moths. I figured that an interesting way to go about this project
                        would be to simulate it with the quintessential patternmaker of today: code.<br><br>
                        With the <a href="https://www.p5js.org/">P5.js library</a> and techniques from
                        computational geometry, I was able to create an algorithm that generates a new image of a
                        unique landscape
                        each
                        time it runs.</p><br>
                    <p>
                        <p class="main-idea-paragraph">The results.</p>
                        <div class="column-container">
                            <img src="../imgs/palette-generator/palettes-variety.png" onClick="makeModal(this)">
                        </div><br>
                        I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of images and 5-color palettes this program could
                        generate. Although I never had an explicit purpose in mind when developing it,
                        a few people reached out to me on Reddit to let me know that they were able to get some use from
                        the palettes. Someone even suggested that I turn this into a wallpaper generator.<br><br>I
                        don't think I will add much more to this project, but I've released the code under an MIT
                        License on GitHub, so hopefully someone takes it and makes something fun with it.

                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Minimal, but impactful.</p>
                    <p>My main organizational goal was to keep the scope of this project small with output that would
                        keep the user entertained for a while. Sometimes,
                        even the simplest projects have potential to make an impact.

                        <br><br>With simplicity in mind, while sketching
                        and
                        ideating, I
                        determined the following features to be
                        essential:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A mountain range generated by 1D Perlin Noise (a function included in P5.js)</li>
                        <li>Starry sky backgrounds</li>
                        <li>A single moon at various phases of the moon cycle</li>
                        <li>A 5-color or 3-color palette extracted from the image</li>
                        <li>Full mobile responsiveness</li>
                        <li>The ability to export the image to SVG or PNG format</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>By applying a <a href="https://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html">Perlin noise</a>
                        function with
                        varying levels of noise detail to vector coordinates across the x and y axes, I was able to
                        achieve output resembling
                        a mountain range fading into the distance.<br></p>
                    <p>P5.js's built-in noise() function is powerful, but requires significant tweaking to
                        achieve a desired look. I determined the "sweet spot" to base the mountains off to exist
                        somewhere between
                        images 4 and 7 (or 6 and 8 for mobile users).</p>

                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Do you reap what you sow?</p>
                    <p>I realized while creating this program that all the hours I spent trying to create mountains with
                        the Pen tool in Adobe Illustrator could have been trimmed down had I known about something like
                        this. It really made me think: Is a single procedurally-generated organic shape inherently less
                        "valuable" than similar shapes drawn by hand in Illustrator (or something similar)?
                        <br><br>What is the value of a program that can generate an infinite number of graphics compared
                        to an actual graphic designer?
                        <br><br>I don't know.
