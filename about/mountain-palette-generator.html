                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">About this project.</p>
                    <p>This is a small generative graphics program developed mostly with <a
                            href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a>, plus some HTML/CSS interfacing programmed with the
                        JavaScript DOM.
                        It draws
                        a unique landscape with an accompanying 5-color palette upon each page load. Feel free to play
                        around with the <a href="https://anokhee.github.io/landscapes-palette-generator">demo</a>

                    <p>
                        In parts of Georgia bordering North Carolina, the Blue Ridge Mountains hug the horizon from
                        almost every conceivable angle. In
                        sparsely-populated small
                        towns dotted by pastures, warehouses, and gas
                        stations, the snug adjacency to these mountains can evoke a certain emotional affect. Whether
                        that leads to daydreams of an agrarian life in
                        pre-colonial America or scenes from <span class="italics">Deliverance</span> varies, but is
                        interesting nonetheless.

                    <p> As someone prone to romanticism, I really wanted to artistically express my perception of the
                        shapeshifting
                        nature of mountains outside of photography. As a programmer, I figured that an interesting way
                        to go about it
                        would be with code.<br><br>
                        With p5 and techniques from
                        computational geometry, I was able to create an algorithm capable of generating an infinite
                        number of unique landscapes
                        each
                        time it runs. The functionality is purposely minimal â€” I wanted to focus my
                        efforts on the variety and visual appeal of the output versus focusing on the flashiness of the
                        application itself. </p><br>

                        <p>
                            After posting this on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/generative">r/generative</a>, several
                            Reddit users reached out to let me know that they were inspired by or able to get some use
                            from
                            this project, which was really great to hear as a developer. Someone even suggested that I
                            turn it into a
                            wallpaper generator, which is possible considering the scalability of SVG without losing
                            image quality.<br><br>As it
                            stands, I think that this project is mostly finished, but I've released the code under an
                            MIT License on GitHub for anyone to use it as they wish.

                    <p>During planning, I aimed
                        to keep the scope of this project as small as possible, focusing on output
                        varied enough to keep the user entertained for a little while.While sketching
                        and
                        ideating, I
                        determined the following features to be
                        essential:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A mountain range generated by 1D Perlin Noise (a function included in P5.js)</li>
                        <li>Starry sky backgrounds</li>
                        <li>A single moon at various phases of the moon cycle</li>
                        <li>A 5-color or 3-color palette extracted from the image</li>
                        <li>Full mobile responsiveness</li>
                        <li>The ability to export the image to SVG or PNG format</li>

                    <p>By applying a <a href="https://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html">Perlin noise</a>
                        function with
                        varying levels of noise detail to vector coordinates across the x and y axes, I was able to
                        achieve output resembling
                        a mountain range fading into the distance.<br></p>
                    <p>P5.js's built-in noise() function is powerful, but requires significant tweaking to
                        achieve a desired look. I determined the "sweet spot" to base the mountains off to exist
                        somewhere between
                        images 4 and 7 (or 6 and 8 for mobile users).</p>

                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Do you reap what you sow?</p>
                    <p>I realized that the hours I spent trying to create vector landscapes with
                        Adobe Illustrator could have been trimmed down had I known about
                        Perlin Noise. It really made me think: Is a single procedurally-generated organic
                        shape
                        inherently less
                        "valuable" than those drawn by hand?
                        <br><br>What is the value of a program that can generate an infinite number of graphics compared
                        to an actual graphic designer? How special is uniqueness, really, when it's produced
                        algorithmically?
                        <br><br>I don't know.
