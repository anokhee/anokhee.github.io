                        Drafting SVGs from the comfort of a web browser // A friendly alternative to the Pen tool.

                        Beautiful Faces is an interactive web tool that allows users to edit a vector-based face and
                        export it to the image software of their choice.
                        <br><br>
                        While I was teaching myself how to use Adobe Illustrator, I felt a lot of frustration drawing
                        shapes with the Pen
                        tool, especially when it came to curves.
                        <br><br>
                        I wanted to develop a web-based tool allowing users to quickly draft a symmetrical face, then
                        export it to SVG to edit further in Illustrator or Inkscape. As it stands, this project is a
                        barebones prototype, but I believe there is value in vector drafting software for non-designers,
                        beginners, and anyone seeking a sense of flexibility and ownership over the open source graphics
                        they use.

                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">The love and woe of Bezier curves.</p>
                    <p>A face is drawn to the screen as a collection of vertex control points connecting Bezier curves.
                        For those unfamiliar with plotting Bezier curves, the GIF below demonstrates where the control
                        points lie on the plane and how they pull on a curve:

                    <p> The code itself was fairly straightforward to write, as the major (and only)
                        functionality of the program was to manipulate numberical values with sliders. The difficulty
                        was in drawing Bezier curves to the screen, which required a thoughtful sketching
                        process.</p>

                        <p>Most default profile images feature decidedly male silhouettes with caucasian-looking
                            hairstyles and features. While this may seem inconsequential, it reinforces the idea of the
                            white male user as the "default person", which can (and usually does) unconsciously alienate
                            minority users.

                            <br><br>When randomization is applied to the algorithm generating these faces, the
                            results are more gender-neutral, inclusive, and lighthearted than the typical default
                            profile picture, which tends to look ominous.

                            In community-based sites and applications, users are encouraged to upload a profile picture
                            before contributing to public forums or engaging with other members of the community.
                            Unfortunately, the default profile image can sometimes appear casual/non-participatory at
                            best and creepy at worst.
                            <br><br>
                            If a web-based vector editing software is built into an application as a "Customize Your
                            Avatar" feature, it provides an easy solution for users who don't feel comfortable uploading
                            a photo of themselves, and an even better solution for lazy users. Without having to search
                            for an image to use as a profile picture,
                            they can quickly create one that resembles themselves in-app.</p>

                        <p class="main-idea-paragraph">SVG = superfast jellyfish.</p>
                        <p>
                            SVG is highly performant and scalable. This has benefits from a software engineering
                            perspective on the front end and back end.
                            <br><br>
                            On the front end, SVG is useful because it is programmable with CSS and JavaScript and
                            maintains perfect image quality at any resolution. On the back end, storing SVG is more
                            efficient because SVG ~70% smaller than an identical PNG on average.
