                <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Drafting SVGs from the comfort of a web browser.</p>
                <p> Beautiful Faces is an interactive web tool that allows users to edit a vector-based face and
                    export it to the image software of their choice.</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p class="main-idea-paragraph">
                    A friendly alternative to the Pen tool.
                </p>
                <p>While teaching myself Adobe Illustrator, I struggled with using the Pen tool to draw curved shapes. I
                    developed Beautiful Faces as a web-based tool allowing users to quickly draft a symmetrical face
                    to either use as a quick profile picture or identicon or export to SVG to edit further in the
                    graphics software of their choice.<br><br>
                    As it stands, this project is a barebones prototype, but I believe there is value in vector editing
                    software for non-designers, beginners, or anyone seeking a sense of flexibility and ownership over
                    the open source graphics they use. </p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p class="main-idea-paragraph">The love and woe of Bezier curves.</p>
                <p>The code itself was fairly straightforward to write, as the major (and only)
                    functionality of the program was to manipulate geometric proportions with sliders.<br><br>
                    Each face is made up of a series of Bezier curves.
                    Drawing Bezier curves to the screen was the most difficult part of this project, requiring a
                    thoughtful sketching
                    process. The GIF below demonstrates where each of
                    the vertex control points like on the plane.

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Inclusive default identicons.</p>
                    <p>Most default profile images feature decidedly male silhouettes with caucasian-looking
                        hairstyles and features. While this may seem inconsequential, it reinforces the idea of the
                        white male user as the "default person", which can (and usually does) unconsciously alienate
                        minority users.

                        <br><br>When randomization is applied to the algorithm generating these faces, the
                        results are more gender-neutral, inclusive, and lighthearted than the typical default
                        profile picture, which tends to look ominous.

                    </p>

                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Facilitating trustworthy interactions between users.</p>
                    <p>
                        In community-based sites and applications, users are encouraged to upload a profile picture
                        before contributing to public forums or engaging with other members of the community.
                        Unfortunately, the default profile image can sometimes appear casual/non-participatory at
                        best and creepy at worst.
                        <br><br>
                        If a web-based vector editing software is built into an application as a "Customize Your
                        Avatar" feature, it provides an easy solution for users who don't feel comfortable uploading
                        a photo of themselves, and an even better solution for lazy users. Without having to search
                        for an image to use as a profile picture,
                        they can quickly create one that resembles themselves in-app.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">SVG = superfast jellyfish.</p>
                    <p>
                        SVG is highly performant and scalable. This has benefits from a software engineering
                        perspective on the front end and back end.
                        <br><br>
                        On the front end, SVG is useful because it is programmable with CSS and JavaScript and
                        maintains perfect image quality at any resolution. On the back end, storing SVG is more
                        efficient because SVG ~70% smaller than an identical PNG on average.
