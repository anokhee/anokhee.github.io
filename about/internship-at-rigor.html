                        What is Rigor?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rigor is a small SaaS company located in Atlanta, Georgia providing users with powerful tools to
                        optimize and monitor their website's performance. With Rigor, users can access metrics related
                        to user experience, APIs, and uptime, benchmark their site's performance against industry
                        leaders, and diagnose and repair technical issues or answer business questions.
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">
                        A creative and open-ended solo project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the concluding week of my internship, I was given an opportunity to pursue my design
                        interests via a 2-week solo project. The instruction was simply to find an area of Rigor's app
                        that could be improved and design/develop a functional prototype to support it. At the end of
                        the two weeks, I would present the idea to
                        the engineering team.
                        <br><br>
                        The goal was not to deliver a production-ready new feature, but to spark discussion about user
                        needs while accounting for how modern web design paradigms can be applied to the existing app.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Analytics redesign.</h3>
                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">
                        Reimagining existing analytics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of my own concerns about it and a few mentions in Rigor’s technical support Slack
                        channel, I decided to try to modernize the following analytics chart:
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="../imgs/internship-at-rigor/rigor-before-redesign.png" onClick="makeModal(this)">
                        <br><br>
                        The chart appears on the Results page of one of Rigor’s most popular features. It displays
                        information about various performance metrics based on the user’s custom configuration, then
                        compares each metric with its results from the previous run.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">
                        Identifying pain points.
                    </p>
                    <p>My first step was to identify the major pain points of the current implementation. Due to the
                        2-week time constraint, I wasn't able to conduct user interviews to understand the customers'
                        mindsets, however, I was able to rely on my
                        supervisor, coworkers, and information gleaned from product tickets in JIRA
                        for insight about possible user frustrations.
                        <br>
                        Because the prototype would be programmed into the existing React application, I
                        figured that the most intuitive way to plan this project was to break the current chart down
                        into its most basic components while proposing guiding questions along the way.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="../imgs/internship-at-rigor/rigor-pain-points.png" onClick="makeModal(this)">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>After doing this, I could construct a foundation for the information architecture. I listed
                        handful of painpoints that would serve as
                        milestones while designing and developing this project:
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Appearance of horizontal scrollbar when a user selects too many metrics</li>
                            <li> Poor information hierarchy that makes it difficult for users to prioritize important
                                metrics or derive meaningful
                                information from
                                the page at a glance</li>
                            <li> Unnecessary UI components, like tooltips, flourishes, and links that clutter the page
                                and distract from the story the data should be telling</li>
                            <li>
                                Crowded layout with small text may be inaccessible to users with poor vision</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">
                        Understanding users.
                    </p>
                    <p>With information gathered throughout the semester from cross-departmental meetings, customer
                        support tickets, and discussions with my supervisor, I synthesized two major personas that
                        reflected
                        Rigor's primary user base. These personas are based around age, level of experience with
                        technology, role, and personality, with a few hypothetical questions to guide the design
                        process.
                    </p>

                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">
                        Charts that answer business questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My favorite part of this project was figuring out how charts can be used to
                        answer business questions, rather than exist only for the sake of interactivity and
                        visualization. Because
                        bar charts are widely used and the data from this project could be plotted along an X and Y axis
                        easily, I stuck with using them for this prototype.
                        <br><br>
                        With more time, I would have loved to have explored these questions further.

                    <p>
                        D3 and React manipulate the DOM differently, which meant I had to brute-force some (arguably)
                        icky code to build the interactivity and styling of the charts. With more time, I would have
                        researched alternative libraries or methods of integrating the two libraries. From my
                        understanding, this is a common problem with many solutions.</p>

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Normalizing Data</p>
                    <br>
                    <img style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;" src="../imgs/internship-at-rigor/rigor-alexa-data.png">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning, I had some difficulty visualizing the data in a way that was immediately
                        meaningful. The data is all displayed in wildly incompatible units like bytes, seconds, and
                        counts, so what might be the ideal file count would almost certainly be an impossible byte size,
                        and would not be helpful if displayed on the same graph.
                        <br><br>
                        After speaking with my supervisor, he suggested that the data might be more meaningful to users
                        if it was converted into percentiles based on Amazon Web Services' Alexa Top Sites data.
                        <br><br>
                        To break down the percentile ranks from the 0th - 99th, we configured AWS to generate a JSON
                        file with discrete data.
                        <br><br>
                        Now that I had the data in percentile ranks, I quickly encountered another issue: I would have
                        to convert up to 3,860 unique values into individual percentiles. To accomplish this, I wrote an
                        algorithm that normalized those values and mapped them to a D3 chart.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="main-idea-paragraph">What I'd do next time...</p>
                    <p>Working on a multidisciplinary project within a limited timeframe was interesting because
                        it demonstrated the immediate importance of careful planning, research, and teamwork in
                        software development.
                        <br><br>
                        With more time I would:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Experiment with ways to effectively display data visualizations on mobile devices
                        </li>
                        <li>Conduct user interviews and testing to gain additional insights into pain points for
                            future iterations

                    <br>
                    <p>When designing data analytics reports and visualizations, I learned that it’s important
                        to remember that even the most experienced users of your application don’t have as clear
                        an understanding of the data as you do as an engineer. While bar charts, pie charts, and
                        line graphs are well-known forms of data visualization, extra care must be put in to
                        ensure that they don't simply exist as an eye-catching design component, but to tell
                        meaningful stories about the data.
