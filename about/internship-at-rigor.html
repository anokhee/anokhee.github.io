                <p class="main-idea-paragraph">About Rigor</p>
                <p>Rigor is a small SaaS company located in Atlanta, Georgia providing users with powerful tools to
                    optimize and monitor their website's performance. With Rigor, users can access metrics related
                    to user experience, APIs, and uptime, benchmark their site's performance against industry
                    leaders, and diagnose and repair technical issues or answer business questions.

            <p class="main-idea-paragraph">A creative and open-ended solo project</p>
            <p>During the concluding week of my internship, I was given the opportunity to pursue my design
                interests via a 2-week solo project. At the end of the two weeks, I would present the idea to
                the engineering team. My only instruction was to
                find an area of the Rigor app that could be added to or improved upon, then design and develop a
                functional prototype of a solution.<br><br>

                <h3>Analytics Redesign</h3>
                <p>Because of my own concerns about it and a few mentions in Rigor’s technical support Slack channel, I
                    decided
                    to go with a redesign of this analytics chart.<br><br> The chart appears on the Results page of one
                    of
                    Rigor’s
                    most popular features and displays information about various performance metrics based on the user’s
                    custom
                    configuration, then compares each metric with its results from the previous run.

                <p class=" main-idea-paragraph">Identifying pain points.</p>
                <p>My first step was to identify the major pain points of the chart I was redesigning. Due to the 2-week
                    I wasn't able to conduct user interviews. Fortunately, I was able to rely on my supervisor,
                    coworkers, information gleaned from
                    product tickets in JIRA, and my own experiences for insight about possible user frustrations.
                    <br><br>
                    Understanding that the prototype would be programmed into the existing React application, I figured
                    that
                    the most intuitive way to plan this project was to break the current chart down into its most basic
                    components while proposing guiding questions along the way.<br><br>

        </div>

        <div class="column-full">
            <p>By doing this, I was able to construct the building blocks required to organize (and iteratively
                re-organize) the flow of information. I came up with a handful of painpoints that would serve as
                milestones while designing and developing this project:
                <ul>
                    <li>The appearance of horizontal scrollbar when too many metrics are selected by the user</li>
                    <li>Poor information hierarchy making it difficult for users to derive meaningful information
                        from the page at a glance (and no way to prioritize metrics)</li>
                    <li>Unnecessary UI components, like tooltips, flourishes, and links that clutter the page and
                        distract from the "big picture"</li>
                    <li>Crowded layout with small text that may be inaccessible to users with poor vision</li>
                </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="column-full">
            <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Understanding the users.</p>
            <p>With information gathered throughout the semester from cross-departmental meetings, customer support
                tickets, and discussions with my supervisor, I synthesized a few personas to reflect Rigor's
                primary user base. These personas are based around age, level of experience with technology, role,
                and personality, with a few hypothetical questions to guide the design process.

            <p>Some generalizations I was able to make:
                <ul>
                    <li>Rigor's users are, in general, more technically-savvy than the average Internet user
                    </li>
                    <li>Ideally, users don't want to have to spend a lot of time in the Rigor app unless they are
                        investigating an issue or configuring settings
                    </li>
                    <li>Configurations should require as little modification as possible
                    </li>
                    <li>The redesign is based on a desktop-only feature, so mobile-friendliness is not a factor to
                        consider (yet)
                    </li>
                </ul><br>

        <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Charts that answer questions.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite parts of this project was trying to figure out how charts can be used to answer
            questions rather than exist for the sake of interactivity and visualization only. Because bar charts
            are
            widely known as some of the most
            intuitive charts to use, I came up with a few business questions to
            chart and represent the data in both the
            mockup and final presentation.<br><br> With more time, it would have been worthwhile to spend more
            time researching
            how visualizations can be used to answer questions, rather than exist for their own sake.

            <p>D3 and React manipulate the DOM differently, which meant I had to brute-force some (arguably) icky code
                to
                build the interactivity and styling of the charts. With more time, I would have researched alternative
                libraries or methods of integrating the two libraries. From my understanding, this is a common problem
                with
                many solutions.</p>

                <p class="main-idea-paragraph">Challenge: Normalizing Data</p>
                <p>At the beginning, I had some difficulty visualizing the data in a way that was immediately
                    meaningful.
                    The data is all displayed in wildly incompatible units like bytes, seconds, and counts, so what
                    might be
                    the ideal file count would almost certainly be an impossible byte size, and would not be helpful if
                    displayed on the same graph.

                    <br><br>After speaking with my supervisor, he suggested that the data might be
                    more
                    meaningful to users if it was converted into percentiles based on Amazon Web Services' Alexa Top
                    Sites
                    data.<br><br>
                    To break down the percentile ranks from the 0th - 99th, we configured AWS to generate a JSON file
                    with
                    discrete data.<br><br>
                    Now that I had the data in percentile ranks, I quickly encountered another issue: I would have to
                    convert up to 3,860 unique values into individual percentiles. To accomplish this, I wrote an
                    algorithm that normalized those values and mapped them to a D3 chart.
